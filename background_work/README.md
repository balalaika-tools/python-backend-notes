# Background Work

> A failure-first design course for work that outlives a request, process, delivery, or human wait.

The framework-neutral notes build one editorial workflow from failure to mechanism to implementation to verification. Framework notes show which responsibilities particular runtimes own; they are not substitutes for the business guarantees in the reliability section.

## Core Design

| File | Topic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [01_overview.md](01_overview.md) | Responsibility model | Separates workflow, execution, delivery, workers, schedulers, and engines |
| [02_when_a_task_becomes_a_workflow.md](02_when_a_task_becomes_a_workflow.md) | Workflow threshold | Decides when progress has durable business meaning and when one job is enough |
| [03_minimal_durable_task.md](03_minimal_durable_task.md) | Minimal durable task | Builds one API-created job through claim, result lookup, retry, and safe replay |
| [03_state_machine_design.md](03_state_machine_design.md) | Three design axes | Separates transition modeling, state persistence/concurrency, and work execution |
| [state_machines/](state_machines/README.md) | State-machine deep dives | Compares code models, relational CAS, event streams, and the complete workflow lifecycle |

The two `03` notes are deliberate branches after the threshold decision: read the durable-task note when one job is enough, and state-machine design when progress has durable business meaning. The full production course reads both to make the escalation boundary concrete.

## Delivery, Execution, and Timing

| File | Topic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [04_queue_and_worker_architectures.md](04_queue_and_worker_architectures.md) | Queue architectures | Compares database queues, brokers/outbox, managed queues, engines, and choreography |
| [05_task_execution_models.md](05_task_execution_models.md) | Execution models | Selects processes, bounded threads, or bounded coroutines from workload behavior |
| [06_scheduling_and_periodic_work.md](06_scheduling_and_periodic_work.md) | Scheduling | Defines cron/interval, timezone/DST, misfire, catch-up, overlap, and replica-safe firings |

---

## Reliability and Composition

| File | Topic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [reliability/](reliability/README.md) | Reliability deep dives | Implements atomic intent, fencing, idempotency, retry/cancellation, reconciliation, and operations |
| [07_durable_fanout_and_join.md](07_durable_fanout_and_join.md) | Fan-out/join | Persists bounded child sets, idempotent completion, and one aggregate handoff |

---

## Production Operations

| File | Topic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [operations/](operations/README.md) | Security, tenancy, and capacity | Secures trigger/control paths, bounds tenant demand, preserves fairness, and sizes worker fleets against shared ceilings |
| [08_failure_injection_and_testing.md](08_failure_injection_and_testing.md) | Failure testing | Exercises crash, redelivery, lease, authorization, tenant-isolation, cancellation, outbox, retry, and redrive races |

---

## Selection and Frameworks

| File | Topic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [09_decision_guide.md](09_decision_guide.md) | Decision guide | Turns durability, state, workload, and operational constraints into the smallest suitable system |
| [frameworks/](frameworks/README.md) | Framework notes | Worker runtimes, schedulers, orchestrator selection, Step Functions, Temporal, Airflow, and LangGraph |

## Reading Order

### First durable task

**For**: API engineers meeting background work for the first time.

**Working result by entry 2**: submit one independent task, return a status URL, claim and retry it,
then explain which state belongs to the application rather than the delivery mechanism.

1. **Do:** [Minimal Durable Task](03_minimal_durable_task.md) — build the complete `PENDING → RUNNING → terminal` baseline.
2. **Understand:** [Overview](01_overview.md) — separate the business promise from delivery and execution around that result.
3. **Escalate only when needed:** [When a Task Becomes a Workflow](02_when_a_task_becomes_a_workflow.md).
4. **Decide:** [Decision Guide](09_decision_guide.md) — check that database polling, a broker, or a managed queue matches the actual constraints.

**Stop here if** the product needs one independent, replay-safe task and a result lookup endpoint. Continue to [State-Machine Design](03_state_machine_design.md) when intermediate business states, branching, joins, human signals, or compensation become durable requirements. Continue to [Reliability](reliability/README.md) when the baseline encounters external side effects, long leases, cancellation races, or operational repair.

### Full production design course

**For**: engineers implementing and operating multi-step background workflows.

Read `01` → `02` → the minimal durable task → state-machine design and [state-machine implementations](state_machines/README.md) → `04` → `05` → `06` → [reliability](reliability/README.md) → `07` → [operations](operations/README.md) → `08` → `09`.

The first operational milestone is one state transition that atomically creates work and can recover an expired attempt. Continue through fan-out and multitenancy only when the product actually splits work or tenants compete for shared capacity.

### Database-backed workflow implementation

Read `01`, `02`, the [minimal durable task](03_minimal_durable_task.md), and [State-Machine Design](03_state_machine_design.md), then follow [the end-to-end workflow](state_machines/04_end_to_end_workflow.md), the [reliability deep dives](reliability/README.md), and [production operations](operations/README.md) before running the failure matrix.

### Decision-first and orchestration evaluation

- **Choose quickly** — start with the [Decision Guide](09_decision_guide.md), then follow only the link for the mechanism that changes the decision.
- **Evaluate orchestration runtimes** — read [State-Machine Design](03_state_machine_design.md), then [Workflow Orchestrator Selection](frameworks/00_workflow_orchestrator_selection.md), then the relevant [framework note](frameworks/README.md).
