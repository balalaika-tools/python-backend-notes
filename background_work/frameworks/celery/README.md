## Reading Order

**Working result by entry 1**: run the overview's smallest broker-backed task and observe the worker result.

1. **Do:** [Celery overview](overview.md) — run one task before evaluating the full runtime.
2. **Understand when needed:** [Queue and worker architectures](../../04_queue_and_worker_architectures.md) and [task execution models](../../05_task_execution_models.md).
3. **Decide:** use the [general decision guide](../../09_decision_guide.md) before committing to Celery for durable business state or multi-step workflows.

**Stop here if** Celery's delivery, pool, and acknowledgement boundaries match one independent
task. Continue into reliability notes when effects, replay, cancellation, or repair become product contracts.
