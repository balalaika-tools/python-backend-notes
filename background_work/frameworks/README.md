## Contents

Start with the **workflow orchestrator selection** row only when a process has durable multi-step coordination; otherwise jump directly to the scheduler or worker runtime that matches the task.

| Framework | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **[Workflow orchestrator selection](00_workflow_orchestrator_selection.md)** | **Architecture decision** | **Relates custom DB/broker coordination to Step Functions, Temporal, Airflow, and LangGraph** |
| [Celery](celery/README.md) | Task queue and worker runtime | Brokers, results, pools, acknowledgements, routing, retries, Beat, and outbox boundaries |
| [Dramatiq](dramatiq/README.md) | Task queue and worker runtime | Actors, brokers, middleware, retries, rate limits, composition, and monitoring |
| [Dramatiq + FastAPI](dramatiq/fastapi_integration.md) | Web integration | Durable status records, broker initialization, testing, containers, and worker scaling |
| [APScheduler](apscheduler/README.md) | Scheduler | Triggers, FastAPI integration, misfires, persistent stores, overlap, and multi-instance deployment |
| [Airflow](airflow/README.md) | Data-workflow orchestrator | DAGs, scheduling, backfills, executors, metadata, and operational boundaries |
| [Temporal-class engines](temporal/README.md) | Durable workflow engine | Deterministic workflow replay, activities, timers, signals, versioning, and idempotency boundaries |
| [LangGraph](langgraph/README.md) | Checkpointed graph runtime | Persisted graph state, interrupts/resume, time travel, graph evolution, and replay-safe effects |

## Reading Order

Choose one deterministic branch; do not read every framework.

### Run a scheduled callback

**Working result by entry 1**: execute one persisted, overlap-aware APScheduler firing.

1. **Do:** [APScheduler overview](apscheduler/overview.md).
2. **Understand:** [Scheduling and periodic work](../06_scheduling_and_periodic_work.md) — distinguish a stored schedule from an exactly-once business effect.

**Stop here if** one application owns scheduling and execution. Continue to a task queue when work
must be distributed independently of the scheduler process.

### Run independent broker-backed tasks

**Working result by entry 1**: execute one worker task and observe its result.

1. **Do:** choose [Celery](celery/overview.md) or [Dramatiq](dramatiq/overview.md), not both.
2. **Understand:** [Queue and worker architectures](../04_queue_and_worker_architectures.md) and [task execution models](../05_task_execution_models.md).
3. **Harden:** [Atomic transitions and outbox](../reliability/01_atomic_transitions_and_outbox.md), [idempotent effects](../reliability/03_idempotency_and_external_effects.md), and [reconciliation](../reliability/05_reconciliation_dlq_and_observability.md).

**Stop here if** each job is an independent unit with application-owned status. Continue to an
engine when the product needs durable multi-step coordination, signals, or long-lived timers.

### Run a durable workflow

**Working result by entry 2**: choose an engine boundary and run the selected framework's smallest
durable workflow or checkpoint/resume trace.

1. **Decide:** [Workflow orchestrator selection](00_workflow_orchestrator_selection.md).
2. **Do one branch:** [Temporal](temporal/overview.md), [Airflow](airflow/overview.md), or [LangGraph](langgraph/overview.md), according to that decision.
3. **Harden:** [Retries, timeouts, and cancellation](../reliability/04_retries_timeouts_and_cancellation.md) plus the exact reliability note named by the chosen engine's external-effect boundary.

**Stop here if** the evaluation proves the required recovery, deployment, and external-effect
contract. Compare a second product only when a named requirement remains unmet.
