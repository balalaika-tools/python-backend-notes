# 01 — The Testing Mental Model

> **Key insight**: Choose the lowest test layer that can observe the failure being protected against.

## Why Test?

Tests are not about proving code works. Tests are about **catching regressions** and **enabling fearless refactoring**.

Without tests:

- Every deploy is a gamble
- Refactoring is terrifying
- Bugs are discovered by users

With tests:

- You change code and know within seconds if something broke
- New team members can't silently break existing behavior
- Your CI pipeline becomes a safety net

## What to Test

Not everything deserves a test. Focus on **value per test**.

| Priority | What to Test | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | Request/response contracts | Catches API-breaking changes |
| 2 | Business logic (services) | Core value of your app |
| 3 | Auth and permissions | Security regressions are expensive |
| 4 | Error handling paths | Users hit these more than you think |
| 5 | Edge cases (empty lists, nulls) | Where most production bugs hide |
| 6 | Integration with DB | Schema changes break things silently |

What NOT to test:

- FastAPI/Pydantic internals (they're already tested)
- Trivial pass-through endpoints with no logic
- Third-party library behavior

## The Test Pyramid

```
         /  E2E  \          Few — slow, brittle, expensive
        /----------\
       / Integration \      Some — test component boundaries
      /----------------\
     /    Unit Tests     \  Many — fast, isolated, cheap
    /____________________\
```

For FastAPI backends:

- **Unit tests** — pure functions, validators, business logic, no framework involvement. See [03 — Unit Testing](03_unit_testing.md).
- **Integration tests** — endpoints with test DB and dependency overrides. See [04 — Endpoint Testing](04_endpoint_testing.md).
- **E2E tests** — full stack with external services (usually in CI only, nightly).

Classify a test by the real boundary it exercises. A test of one component with its collaborators
replaced is a unit test even if it is slow; a test that composes the API, database adapter, and
transaction behavior is an integration test even if it finishes in 50 ms. Network access and
runtime are common consequences of broader boundaries, not the definition.

---

## Unit vs Integration — A Concrete Distinction

The line is fuzzy in FastAPI projects because a single function can often be exercised at either level. A working definition:

| Level | Boundary | Example | Where it lives |
|-------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Unit** | One function/class, no I/O | `validate_email("x@y.com")` returns `True` | [03](03_unit_testing.md) |
| **Integration** | Multiple components, real DB, ASGI stack | `POST /users` returns 201 and row appears in DB | [04](04_endpoint_testing.md), [08](08_database_testing.md) |
| **E2E** | Full system, real upstreams | Browser → API → DB → Stripe sandbox | Out of scope — nightly only |

Both unit and integration are valuable. They catch *different* bugs. A unit test catches "this function has the wrong branch"; an integration test catches "this function is wired up wrong" or "the migration renamed a column".

## Test Doubles — The Taxonomy

When you can't use the real thing, you substitute it. The four common substitutes, from least to most behavior:

| Double | What it does | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Dummy** | Placeholder, never used | An unused `user` arg passed to satisfy a signature |
| **Stub** | Returns hard-coded values | `get_weather()` always returns `{"temp": 15}` |
| **Fake** | Working but simplified implementation | In-memory dict standing in for a database |
| **Mock** | Verifies interactions | Asserts `charge()` was called with specific args |

**Common mistake:** using "mock" to mean all of the above. The distinction matters — mocks can make tests brittle (they assert *how* something was called, not just *what* came back). Prefer stubs and fakes for most cases; reach for mocks when the interaction itself is the contract under test.

Covered in practical detail in [03 — Unit Testing](03_unit_testing.md) and [09 — Mocking External Services](09_mocking_external.md).

## The AAA Pattern

Structure every test as three blocks:

```python
def test_user_discount_applied():
    # Arrange — set up inputs
    user = make_user(tier="premium")
    cart = Cart(items=[Item(price=100)])

    # Act — perform the operation under test
    total = checkout(user, cart)

    # Assert — verify the outcome
    assert total == 90  # 10% premium discount
```

A test that mixes arrange/act/assert lines ("`assert create_user(...)["id"] == 1`") hides intent. Separating them makes failures self-diagnosing.

---

## FIRST Principles

A good test is:

- **Fast** — runs in milliseconds, not seconds
- **Isolated** — order-independent, no shared mutable state
- **Repeatable** — same result every run, no time/network dependencies
- **Self-validating** — passes or fails, no manual log inspection
- **Timely** — written with the code, not weeks later

Tests that violate these principles are technical debt — they get disabled, skipped, or ignored when they go red.
