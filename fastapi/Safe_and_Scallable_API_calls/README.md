# Safe and Scalable External API Calls

> **Purpose**: Production-grade patterns for calling LLMs, agents, and external APIs from FastAPI.

---

## Prerequisites

Before reading this guide, understand HTTPX internals:

**[HTTPX Guide](../../httpx/README.md)** — connection pooling, timeouts, and HTTP client behavior.

---

## Core Principle

> **Concurrency is a transport-layer reality.**
> **Anything that does not limit sockets is advisory.**

The only hard concurrency limit in an external API system is imposed by the **HTTP client** via the number of simultaneously open sockets.

## The Non-Negotiable Layers

A safe production stack requires all of these:

1. **Client connection limits** — hard physical cap on sockets
2. **Client transport timeouts** — real request termination
3. **Semaphore** — logical concurrency gate
4. **Rate limiter** — vendor quota compliance
5. **Application timeout** — task cancellation & system safety
6. **Queue timeout** — fail fast under overload

Removing any layer introduces known failure modes.

## Quick Start

### Minimal Safe Pattern

```python
import asyncio
import httpx
from aiolimiter import AsyncLimiter

# Client with mandatory connection limits
client = httpx.AsyncClient(
    limits=httpx.Limits(max_connections=50, max_keepalive_connections=20),
    timeout=httpx.Timeout(connect=5.0, read=30.0, write=10.0, pool=5.0),
)

# Application-level controls
sem = asyncio.Semaphore(50)
rate = AsyncLimiter(60, 60)


async def call_api(payload: dict):
    for attempt in range(3):
        try:
            async with asyncio.timeout(5):      # queue timeout
                async with rate:                 # throughput control
                    async with sem:              # concurrency gate
                        async with asyncio.timeout(30):  # call timeout
                            response = await client.post(url, json=payload)
                            response.raise_for_status()
                            return response.json()
        
        except httpx.TimeoutException:
            if attempt < 2:
                await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)
                continue
            raise
        
        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            if attempt == 0:
                await asyncio.sleep(1)
                continue
            raise
```

## Key Principles

1. **Client limits are the only hard limit** — everything else is advisory
2. **`asyncio.timeout` does NOT terminate sockets** — only client timeouts do
3. **Rate limiting ≠ concurrency control** — they serve different purposes
4. **Retries must be outside semaphore** — never sleep while holding resources
5. **Per-pod limits don't protect vendors** — use Redis for global limits
6. **Queue timeout is not retryable** — overload should fail fast

---

## Common Mistakes This Guide Prevents

❌ Client without connection limits (unbounded sockets)
❌ Relying only on `asyncio.timeout` for request termination
❌ Semaphore inside retry loop (holding resource during sleep)
❌ No queue timeout (unbounded queues)
❌ Per-pod rate limiters for vendor protection
❌ In-memory circuit breakers in multi-pod setups
❌ Catching only `asyncio.TimeoutError` (missing httpx exceptions)
❌ Retrying queue timeouts (amplifies overload)
