# gRPC: A Focused Overview

> **Who this is for**: Engineers evaluating typed service-to-service RPC or integrating an existing gRPC service.

> **Key insight**: Generated call syntax preserves a typed contract, but the call still has network ambiguity, deadlines, compatibility rules, and retry semantics.

---

## 1️⃣ The Mental Model

**gRPC** makes a remote operation look like a typed method call while retaining distributed-system controls such as deadlines, cancellation, metadata, and status codes.

```text
orders.proto
    │ protoc + plugins
    ├──────────────> generated Python client stub
    └──────────────> generated Go server interface

client stub ══ HTTP/2 + protobuf messages ══> server handler
```

Protocol Buffers are gRPC's default interface definition language and message format. The `.proto` contract generates types and client/server bindings for supported languages.

---

## 2️⃣ Service Definition

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package orders.v1;

service OrderService {
  rpc GetOrder(GetOrderRequest) returns (Order);
  rpc WatchOrder(WatchOrderRequest) returns (stream OrderUpdate);
}

message GetOrderRequest {
  string order_id = 1;
}

message Order {
  string order_id = 1;
  string status = 2;
  optional string tracking_number = 3;
}

message WatchOrderRequest {
  string order_id = 1;
}

message OrderUpdate {
  string event_id = 1;
  Order order = 2;
}
```

Field numbers identify data on the wire. Never change or reuse a deployed number. When removing a field, reserve its number and preferably its name.

---

## 3️⃣ Four RPC Shapes

| Shape | Request | Response | Example |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| Unary | One | One | Fetch an order |
| Server streaming | One | Many | Watch order updates |
| Client streaming | Many | One | Upload telemetry batches |
| Bidirectional streaming | Many | Many, independently | Interactive control channel |

Streaming is not automatically reliable replay. The application still decides message identity, offsets, acknowledgement, ordering, resumption, and what happens after a broken connection.

---

## 4️⃣ Deadlines, Cancellation, and Status

gRPC clients should set a realistic deadline on every call. The official behavior has no universal default deadline, so an omitted deadline can leave a caller waiting indefinitely.

```python
# Generated modules come from orders.proto.
async def get_order(stub, order_id: str, access_token: str):
    return await stub.GetOrder(
        orders_pb2.GetOrderRequest(order_id=order_id),
        timeout=2.0,
        metadata=(("authorization", f"Bearer {access_token}"),),
    )
```

The server must stop spawned work when the request is cancelled; cancellation does not roll back changes already committed.

Use status codes by meaning:

| Status | Typical meaning | Retry? |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | Input invalid regardless of current state | No |
| `NOT_FOUND` | Requested entity absent | Usually no |
| `FAILED_PRECONDITION` | State must change before retry | Not yet |
| `ABORTED` | Higher-level read-modify-write conflict | Retry whole sequence |
| `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | Quota or capacity exhausted | Only with policy/backoff |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | Transient service failure | Often, for safe/idempotent calls |
| `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` | Caller deadline passed | Outcome may be ambiguous |

Automatic retry requires an explicit service policy and safe operation semantics. An RPC library cannot determine whether repeating `ChargeCard` is safe.

## 5️⃣ Compatibility Rules

Safe Protobuf evolution commonly includes adding a new field. Old readers preserve or ignore unknown fields depending on the operation and runtime; new readers see a default/unset value from old writers.

Do not:

- Change existing field numbers.
- Reuse a removed number.
- Change semantics while leaving the wire type compatible.
- Assume adding an enum value is safe for every generated client's exhaustive switch.
- Confuse binary wire compatibility with ProtoJSON compatibility.

```proto
message Order {
  reserved 3;
  reserved "legacy_tracking_code";

  string order_id = 1;
  string status = 2;
  optional string tracking_number = 4;
}
```

Run a schema compatibility check in CI before generating and publishing clients.

---

## 6️⃣ Operational Fit

gRPC works particularly well between controlled services because it provides generated clients, connection reuse, streaming, health checking, and consistent call metadata.

Account for:

- HTTP/2-aware ingress, proxies, service mesh, load balancers, and observability
- TLS or mutual TLS plus application authorization
- Maximum inbound/outbound message sizes
- Connection age, keepalive, graceful drain, and load balancing behavior
- Deadlines propagated with enough remaining budget for downstream work
- Retry budgets and idempotent operations
- Reflection exposure policy and separate health/readiness behavior

Browsers cannot use the ordinary native gRPC stack directly in the same way as backend clients. **gRPC-Web** and a compatible proxy or server bridge expose supported gRPC services to browser applications, with transport and streaming capabilities that must be checked for the chosen implementation.

---

## 7️⃣ When to Use It

Choose gRPC for owned, polyglot service-to-service systems where generated contracts, compact messages, streaming, and controlled infrastructure are advantages.

Prefer REST when broad third-party accessibility, ordinary browser tooling, CDN caching, or easy manual inspection dominates. Prefer WebSocket when the main requirement is a browser-friendly, long-lived application channel with a custom message protocol.
