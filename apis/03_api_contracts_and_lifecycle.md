# API Contracts and Lifecycle

## Worked compatibility trace

An API currently returns `{"customer_name":"Ada"}` and needs to rename the field to
`display_name`. Deploying the rename in one step breaks every old consumer. Use an overlap:

1. **Expand**: return both fields; old and new consumers both pass.
2. **Migrate**: observe that supported consumers read `display_name`.
3. **Contract**: remove `customer_name` only after the compatibility window closes.

The success signal during expansion is two contract tests—one old schema and one new schema—passing
against the same response. This note later adds version policy, deprecation evidence, and governance;
the trace above is the minimum mechanism they harden.

> **Key insight**: Compatibility is an overlap property of independently deployed producers and
> consumers, not merely a schema-diff result.

## 1. Treat the Contract as a Product

The interface is the part consumers build against. A production contract includes more than a schema:

```text
contract
├── structure     operations, fields, types, formats
├── behavior      invariants, transitions, side effects
├── failure       error taxonomy, retryability, partial success
├── operations    deadlines, limits, ordering, availability
├── security      identity, authorization, sensitive data
└── evolution     compatibility, versions, deprecation policy
```

If a consumer must learn a rule from an incident or provider source code, the contract is incomplete.

## 2. Contract Technologies

| API family | Typical contract artifact | What it describes well |
|------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| RESTful HTTP | OpenAPI plus JSON Schema | Paths, methods, parameters, payloads, responses, security schemes |
| SOAP | WSDL plus XML Schema | Operations, messages, XML types, bindings, service locations |
| GraphQL | GraphQL schema definition language | Types, fields, arguments, operations, nullability, directives |
| gRPC | Protocol Buffer `.proto` files | Services, RPC methods, messages, field numbers, streaming shape |
| WebSocket | AsyncAPI—a machine-readable contract format for asynchronous channels and messages—or a documented message schema | Channels, message envelopes, directions, correlation |
| Webhook | Event catalog plus JSON Schema, OpenAPI, or AsyncAPI | Event types, envelope, payload versions, delivery headers |

Machine-readable artifacts enable generation and checks, but descriptions still need units, invariants, authorization, examples, and operational behavior.

### Schema-first vs code-first

| Approach | Benefit | Risk |
|----------|---------|------|
| Schema-first | Consumers review the boundary before implementation; generation is predictable | Schema can drift if implementation tests are weak |
| Code-first | Low friction and close to implementation types | Internal models and framework defaults can leak into a public contract |

Both can work. The non-negotiable control is **contract conformance in CI**: validate examples, diff changes, run consumer or provider contract tests, and publish only from the tested revision.

## 3. Lifecycle

```text
discover → design → review → implement → verify → publish → operate → deprecate → retire
              ↑                                      │
              └──────────── usage and feedback ──────┘
```

### Discover

Identify consumers, business outcomes, data classification, latency needs, ownership, and alternatives. Do not start with endpoint names.

### Design and review

Review the resource or operation model, error behavior, authorization, abuse cases, compatibility, and operational limits. Include consumer representatives.

### Implement and verify

Validate both directions: requests against input schemas and responses/events against published output schemas. Add integration, negative, compatibility, and load tests.

### Publish and operate

Publish the artifact, examples, changelog, ownership, support path, SLOs, limits, and credentials workflow. Observe operations by stable operation and error identifiers—not raw paths containing IDs.

### Deprecate and retire

Announce an alternative and timeline, measure remaining use, contact consumers, stop new adoption, and remove only after the stated policy allows it. A warning without usage telemetry is guesswork.

---

## 4. Compatibility Rules

Compatibility is about old and new producers and consumers overlapping during deployment.

| Change | Usually safe? | Hidden risk |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Add optional response field | Often | Strict decoders may reject unknown fields |
| Add optional request field | Often | Old providers ignore it; semantics must remain optional |
| Add enum value | Risky | Exhaustive switches can fail |
| Make optional field required | No | Existing requests or stored messages omit it |
| Rename or remove field | No | Consumers still read or send it |
| Change field meaning/unit | No | Wire shape stays valid while behavior corrupts |
| Tighten validation | Risky | Previously accepted traffic begins failing |
| Add a new error or status | Risky | Retry and UX behavior may change |
| Reorder JSON fields | Yes | A signature scheme over reserialized JSON may disagree |

Design consumers with the **robustness rule** appropriate to the format: ignore unknown additive fields, handle unknown enum values defensively, and do not infer meaning from field order. Providers must not silently change semantics.

> **Rule**: “The schema still validates” is weaker than “existing consumers still behave correctly.”

### Expand, migrate, contract

For a rename from `customer_name` to `display_name`:

1. Add `display_name`; continue accepting and returning the old field where required.
2. Migrate producers and consumers while measuring both fields.
3. Stop new use and announce retirement.
4. Remove `customer_name` only after the compatibility window.

This pattern applies to HTTP payloads, GraphQL fields, event schemas, and storage migrations.

## 5. Versioning Strategy

Prefer compatible evolution within one version. Introduce a new major version when semantics cannot coexist safely.

| Strategy | Advantages | Costs |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Path, `/v2/orders` | Visible and easy to route | Resource identity and links can fragment |
| Header/media type | Keeps stable paths | Harder to explore, cache, and support |
| Date or revision | Precise behavior snapshot | Many supported combinations can accumulate |
| Schema evolution without global version | Smooth additive change | Requires excellent field-level discipline |

Version the contract, not the server deployment. `/v2` must describe a coherent compatibility boundary; it is not a release number.

For events, include an explicit event `type` and schema version or make event type names versioned. Do not let the consumer infer version from the current provider deployment.

---

## 6. Documentation That Consumers Need

Every operation or event should document:

- Purpose and when not to use it
- Authentication and required permissions
- Request or message schema with realistic examples
- Success, error, and partial-success behavior
- Idempotency and retry policy
- Timeouts, rate/size limits, pagination, ordering, and retention
- Compatibility and deprecation rules
- Test environment, sample credentials, and replay fixtures
- Support owner and request/event identifiers used for diagnosis

Generate references from the contract, but write task-oriented guides by hand. Generated field tables cannot explain a safe payment retry or webhook recovery workflow.

---

## 7. Governance and Automation

An effective pipeline makes unsafe change visible:

```text
contract change
  → syntax/schema lint
  → breaking-change diff
  → security and ownership review
  → generated clients/docs
  → provider conformance tests
  → consumer contract tests
  → deploy with old/new overlap
  → observe version and operation usage
```

Useful controls:

- Central registry/catalog with owners and lifecycle state
- Naming, pagination, error, authentication, and event-envelope standards
- Schema diff gates with an explicit exception process
- Examples validated as part of the build
- Synthetic checks against deployed endpoints
- Dependency and consumer inventory
- Dashboards for traffic, errors, latency, saturation, retries, and deprecated use

Governance should make the safe path easy. A style guide that is not enforced by templates, linters, and tests becomes archaeology.

## 8. Contract Review Checklist

- [ ] The consumer and business capability are named.
- [ ] Schema and semantics agree; units and invariants are explicit.
- [ ] Authorization is defined per operation, object, and sensitive property.
- [ ] Retryable and terminal failures are distinguishable.
- [ ] Idempotency, ordering, and concurrency behavior are documented.
- [ ] Size, rate, cost, deadline, and retention limits are stated.
- [ ] Additive and breaking-change policies are testable.
- [ ] Examples include malformed, forbidden, conflict, timeout, and duplicate cases.
- [ ] Logs and traces correlate a call without recording secrets.
- [ ] Ownership, SLO, support, deprecation, and retirement are defined.
