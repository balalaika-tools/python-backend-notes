# Caching Patterns

<!-- length-justification: This is the canonical cache-correctness reference; baseline read/write strategies, invalidation, stampede control, and production failure traces remain together because they all modify one version-ordering contract. -->

> **Who this is for**: Backend engineers adding Redis caching without weakening the source-of-truth
> consistency contract.

> **Why cache?** A database query that takes 50ms under load becomes 0.5ms from Redis. Multiply that by thousands of requests per second and caching is the difference between a responsive app and one that buckles. Caching reduces latency, drops database load, and cuts infrastructure costs. The hard part is not caching itself — it is keeping the cache correct.

> **Key insight**: Cache correctness is a version-ordering problem, not merely a choice of expiration
> duration.

## Why Cache?

| Problem | How caching helps |
|---------|-------------------|
| High DB latency | Sub-millisecond reads from memory |
| Repeated identical queries | Serve once, cache many |
| Expensive computation | Compute once, reuse result |
| External API rate limits | Cache responses, reduce calls |
| Cost | Fewer DB connections, smaller instance needed |

---

## Caching Strategies

### 1. Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)

The most common pattern. The application manages the cache explicitly.

```
Read path:
  App --> Cache (HIT?) --> yes --> return
                       --> no  --> DB --> write to Cache --> return

Write path:
  App --> DB --> delete Cache key
```

```python
import json
from typing import Optional
import redis.asyncio as aioredis

async def get_user(r: aioredis.Redis, user_id: str) -> dict:
    cache_key = f"user:{user_id}"

    # 1. Check cache
    cached = await r.get(cache_key)
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)

    # 2. Cache miss — fetch from DB
    user = await db.fetch_user(user_id)

    # 3. Populate cache (TTL = 1 hour)
    await r.setex(cache_key, 3600, json.dumps(user))

    return user

async def update_user(r: aioredis.Redis, user_id: str, data: dict):
    await db.update_user(user_id, data)
    # Invalidate cache — next read will re-populate
    await r.delete(f"user:{user_id}")
```

**Pros:** Only caches what is actually read. Simple to reason about. Cache failure is not fatal (just slower).
**Cons:** First request after miss is slow (cache miss penalty). Stale data possible if TTL is long and DB changes. Potential for cache stampede on hot keys.

#### Generic Cache-Aside Decorator

```python
import functools

def cache_aside(prefix: str, ttl: int = 300):
    """
    Decorator that implements cache-aside pattern.

    Usage:
        @cache_aside("user", ttl=600)
        async def get_user(user_id: int) -> dict:
            return await db.fetch_user(user_id)
    """
    def decorator(func):
        @functools.wraps(func)
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Build cache key from function name and arguments
            key_parts = [str(a) for a in args] + [f"{k}={v}" for k, v in sorted(kwargs.items())]
            cache_key = f"cache:{prefix}:{':'.join(key_parts)}"

            # Check cache
            cached = await async_redis.get(cache_key)
            if cached is not None:
                return json.loads(cached)

            # Cache miss — call function
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)

            # Populate cache (don't cache None results)
            if result is not None:
                await async_redis.set(cache_key, json.dumps(result), ex=ttl)

            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

# Usage
@cache_aside("user", ttl=600)
async def get_user(user_id: int) -> dict:
    return await db.fetch_user(user_id)

@cache_aside("product", ttl=120)
async def get_product(product_id: int, include_reviews: bool = False) -> dict:
    return await db.fetch_product(product_id, include_reviews)
```

### 2. Write-Through

Every write goes to **both** the database and cache. That reduces the usual stale window, but the
two stores do not become one atomic system merely because the application writes both.

```
Write path:
  App --> Cache + DB (simultaneously or sequentially)

Read path:
  App --> Cache (always HIT, in theory)
```

```python
async def update_user(r: aioredis.Redis, user_id: str, data: dict):
    await db.update_user(user_id, data)
    # Update cache immediately
    user = await db.fetch_user(user_id)
    await r.setex(f"user:{user_id}", 3600, json.dumps(user))

async def get_user(r: aioredis.Redis, user_id: str) -> dict:
    cache_key = f"user:{user_id}"

    # Should always be in cache if written through
    cached = await r.get(cache_key)
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)

    # Fall back to DB (cold start or eviction)
    user = await db.fetch_user(user_id)
    if user:
        await r.setex(cache_key, 3600, json.dumps(user))
    return user
```

If the database update commits and the cache write fails, readers can still see the old cached
value. Two concurrent writers can also commit in one order and populate the cache in the opposite
order. The simple function therefore offers **best-effort freshness**, not "always fresh."

For a stronger contract, put a monotonic row version in the database and cache payload. Update the
cache only when the incoming version is newer, or write an outbox event in the same database
transaction and let an idempotent consumer invalidate by version.

**Pros:** Usually serves the newest value without waiting for a cache miss.
**Cons:** Every write is slower, partial failure needs repair, concurrent writers need versioning,
and the cache may hold data that is never read.

### 3. Write-Behind (Write-Back)

Writes go to cache only. Cache flushes to DB asynchronously (in batches or on a timer).

```
Write path:
  App --> Cache (immediate return)
  Cache --> DB (async, batched)
```

```python
import asyncio
import secrets

class WriteBehindCache:
    """
    Writes go to Redis immediately. A background task flushes
    dirty keys to the database periodically.
    """

    def __init__(self, redis_client, db, flush_interval: float = 1.0):
        self.r = redis_client
        self.db = db
        self.flush_interval = flush_interval
        self.dirty_keys: set[str] = set()
        self._lock = asyncio.Lock()

    async def write(self, user_id: int, data: dict):
        cache_key = f"cache:user:{user_id}"

        # Write to Redis immediately
        await self.r.set(cache_key, json.dumps(data), ex=600)

        # Mark key as dirty
        async with self._lock:
            self.dirty_keys.add(cache_key)

    async def flush_loop(self):
        """Background task that flushes dirty keys to DB."""
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(self.flush_interval)

            async with self._lock:
                keys_to_flush = self.dirty_keys.copy()
                self.dirty_keys.clear()

            for key in keys_to_flush:
                try:
                    data = await self.r.get(key)
                    if data:
                        user = json.loads(data)
                        await self.db.execute(
                            "UPDATE users SET name=%s, email=%s WHERE id=%s",
                            (user["name"], user["email"], user["id"]),
                        )
                except Exception as e:
                    # Re-add to dirty set for retry
                    async with self._lock:
                        self.dirty_keys.add(key)
                    print(f"Flush failed for {key}: {e}")
```

**Pros:** Extremely fast writes. Batch DB writes reduce load.
**Cons:** **Data loss risk** if Redis crashes before flush. Complex to implement correctly. Rarely used with Redis directly.

**Use sparingly**. Write-behind is suited for counters (page views, analytics) where losing a few data points is acceptable. Do not use it for financial transactions or anything requiring durability.

### 4. Read-Through

Cache itself fetches from DB on miss. The app never talks to the DB for reads.

```
Read path:
  App --> Cache --> (miss) --> Cache fetches from DB --> returns to App
```

This requires a cache layer that knows how to query your DB — usually a custom abstraction:

```python
class ReadThroughCache:
    """
    Application always calls cache.get(). On miss, the cache
    fetches from DB and populates itself.
    """

    def __init__(self, redis_client, default_ttl: int = 300):
        self.r = redis_client
        self.default_ttl = default_ttl
        self._loaders: dict[str, callable] = {}

    def register_loader(self, prefix: str, loader: callable):
        """Register a function that loads data from DB for a given prefix."""
        self._loaders[prefix] = loader

    async def get(self, prefix: str, key: str, ttl: Optional[int] = None) -> Optional[dict]:
        cache_key = f"cache:{prefix}:{key}"
        ttl = ttl or self.default_ttl

        # Check cache
        cached = await self.r.get(cache_key)
        if cached is not None:
            return json.loads(cached)

        # Cache miss — use registered loader
        loader = self._loaders.get(prefix)
        if loader is None:
            raise ValueError(f"No loader registered for prefix '{prefix}'")

        result = await loader(key)
        if result is not None:
            await self.r.set(cache_key, json.dumps(result), ex=ttl)

        return result

# Setup
cache = ReadThroughCache(redis_client)

async def load_user(user_id: str) -> Optional[dict]:
    return await db.fetch_user(int(user_id))

cache.register_loader("user", load_user)

# Usage — application never touches DB directly
user = await cache.get("user", "42")
```

**Cache-aside vs Read-through**: In cache-aside, the application code manages the cache. In read-through, the cache layer encapsulates the DB lookup. Read-through gives cleaner application code but less flexibility.

### Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Read speed | Write speed | Freshness | Complexity |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Cache-Aside | Fast (hit) / Slow (miss) | Normal | Stale possible | Low |
| Write-Through | Always fast | Slower (2 writes) | Always fresh | Medium |
| Write-Behind | Always fast | Very fast | Eventually consistent | High |
| Read-Through | Fast (hit) / Slow (miss) | Normal | Stale possible | Medium |

```
Mental model:
Cache-aside     = "I'll check the cache myself"
Write-through   = "Always keep cache fresh on write"
Write-behind    = "Cache now, persist later"
Read-through    = "Cache fetches for me"
```

> **Rule of thumb:** Start with cache-aside. It handles 90% of cases. Move to write-through only if stale reads are unacceptable.

---

## TTL Strategies

### Fixed TTL

The simplest approach. Every cache entry gets the same expiration time.

```python
await r.setex("user:123", 3600, data)  # always 3600 seconds
```

### Sliding TTL

Refresh the TTL on every read. Frequently accessed data stays cached longer.

```python
cached = await r.get("user:123")
if cached:
    await r.expire("user:123", 3600)  # reset TTL on hit
```

### Adaptive TTL

Vary TTL based on the nature of the data. Static data gets long TTLs; volatile data gets short TTLs.

```python
TTL_CONFIG = {
    "user_profile": 600,       # 10 min — changes infrequently
    "user_preferences": 3600,  # 1 hour — almost never changes
    "product_price": 60,       # 1 min — can change often
    "stock_count": 10,         # 10 sec — highly volatile
    "static_page": 86400,      # 1 day — rarely changes
}

async def cache_with_adaptive_ttl(r, category: str, key: str, loader):
    cache_key = f"cache:{category}:{key}"
    ttl = TTL_CONFIG.get(category, 300)

    cached = await r.get(cache_key)
    if cached is not None:
        return json.loads(cached)

    result = await loader()
    if result is not None:
        await r.set(cache_key, json.dumps(result), ex=ttl)
    return result
```

### How to Choose

| Strategy | How it works | Use when |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Fixed TTL** | `SET key value EX 3600` — always 3600s | Default choice. Predictable. |
| **Sliding TTL** | Reset TTL on every read (`EXPIRE key 3600`) | Frequently accessed data stays cached longer |
| **Adaptive TTL** | TTL based on data volatility (static = long, dynamic = short) | Mixed data patterns |
| **No TTL** | Explicit invalidation only | Data changes are always event-driven |

| Factor | Short TTL (< 60s) | Medium TTL (1-10 min) | Long TTL (> 10 min) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Data changes | Frequently | Occasionally | Rarely |
| Staleness tolerance | Low | Medium | High |
| Example | Stock count, live scores | User profiles, product details | Static content, config |
| DB load | Higher (more misses) | Balanced | Lower (fewer misses) |

---

## Eviction Policies

When Redis hits `maxmemory`, it must evict keys. Set the policy in `redis.conf`:

```
maxmemory 256mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```

| Policy | Evicts from | Strategy | Use when |
|--------|------------|----------|----------|
| `noeviction` | Nothing | Returns error on write | You manage memory yourself |
| `allkeys-lru` | All keys | Least Recently Used | **Default choice for caching** |
| `volatile-lru` | Keys with TTL | Least Recently Used | Mix of cache + persistent keys |
| `allkeys-lfu` | All keys | Least Frequently Used | Some keys are much hotter than others |
| `volatile-lfu` | Keys with TTL | Least Frequently Used | Hot/cold split with persistent keys |
| `allkeys-random` | All keys | Random | Do not care which keys survive |
| `volatile-ttl` | Keys with TTL | Shortest TTL first | Prioritize longer-lived cache |
| `volatile-random` | Keys with TTL | Random | Mixed workload, simple eviction |

### LRU vs LFU

**LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Evicts the key that was accessed longest ago. Good general-purpose policy, but can be fooled by a one-time scan of many keys pushing out frequently accessed ones.

**LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Tracks access frequency. A key accessed 1000 times per hour will not be evicted by a one-time scan. Better for skewed workloads where a small set of keys handles most traffic.

```
# redis.conf — LFU tuning
lfu-log-factor 10      # how fast the frequency counter grows (higher = slower)
lfu-decay-time 1       # minutes before frequency counter is halved (prevents stale hot keys)
```

> **Recommendation:** Use `allkeys-lru` for pure cache workloads. Use `volatile-lru` if Redis also stores non-cache data (sessions, queues). Switch to `allkeys-lfu` if you notice hot keys being evicted by cold-key scans (check `INFO stats` for `evicted_keys`).

---

## Cache Stampede (Thundering Herd)

### The Problem

A popular cache key expires. Hundreds of concurrent requests all see a cache miss simultaneously and all hit the database:

```
Time 0:     key "hot-data" expires
Time 0.001: Request A --> cache miss --> query DB
Time 0.002: Request B --> cache miss --> query DB
Time 0.003: Request C --> cache miss --> query DB
...
Time 0.050: 200 concurrent DB queries for the same data
```

### Solution 1: Mutex Lock (`SET ... NX EX`)

Only one request fetches from DB. Others wait and retry.

```python
import asyncio

async def get_with_lock(
    r: aioredis.Redis,
    key: str,
    fetch_fn,
    ttl: int = 3600,
    lock_ttl: int = 10,
) -> dict:
    # Try cache first
    cached = await r.get(key)
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)

    # Try to acquire lock
    lock_key = f"lock:{key}"
    owner_token = secrets.token_urlsafe(24)
    acquired = await r.set(lock_key, owner_token, nx=True, ex=lock_ttl)

    if acquired:
        # We won the lock — fetch and populate
        try:
            value = await fetch_fn()
            await r.setex(key, ttl, json.dumps(value))
            return value
        finally:
            await r.eval(
                """
                if redis.call('get', KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then
                    return redis.call('del', KEYS[1])
                end
                return 0
                """,
                1,
                lock_key,
                owner_token,
            )
    else:
        # Someone else is fetching — wait briefly and retry
        for _ in range(50):  # max 5 seconds (50 * 0.1)
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
            cached = await r.get(key)
            if cached:
                return json.loads(cached)

        # Fallback: query DB directly (lock holder may have failed)
        return await fetch_fn()
```

### Aside — Single-Node `SET NX` vs RedLock

The mutex above is a **single-node** Redis lock: one Redis instance, one `SET NX`, one TTL. That's fine when losing the lock is a cache-stampede nuisance, not a correctness issue — the fallback path (fetch again) is safe.

For **distributed mutual exclusion** — "only one worker runs this side effect at a time, across the whole cluster" — there's a tempting algorithm called **RedLock** that uses multiple Redis instances. **Do not adopt RedLock without reading Martin Kleppmann's critique (["How to do distributed locking", 2016](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html)) and antirez's reply.** The short version of the dispute:

- RedLock assumes you can measure elapsed time accurately. **You cannot on a virtualized host** — the scheduler can pause a process for seconds. A process that acquired a lock can be paused until the TTL expires, resume, and happily do its work while another holder is also active.
- A GC pause in your application has the same effect. Between acquiring and doing the work, the JVM / Python can stall long enough for the lock to expire.
- Mitigation requires **fencing tokens** — the lock returns a monotonically-increasing token; every write to the protected resource includes the token; the resource rejects writes with a stale token. This means the resource itself participates in mutual exclusion; the "lock" is just a hint.

**Practical guidance for this corpus:**

- For **cache stampedes** (this section): single-node `SET NX` is fine; the downside is "more DB queries," not correctness.
- For **idempotency keys** (see [`safe_and_scalable_api_calls/11_idempotency.md`](../../fundamentals/fastapi/safe_and_scalable_api_calls/11_idempotency.md)): use a unique constraint in the database, not a Redis lock.
- For **"only one worker should run this cron"**: a single-node Redis lock with a short TTL and idempotent work is usually fine. If duplicate execution would be catastrophic, use a database-backed lock or a proper leader-election primitive (etcd, ZooKeeper, Consul).
- For **cross-region mutual exclusion where correctness matters**: Redis is the wrong tool. Use Postgres advisory locks, or a consensus system (etcd, ZooKeeper).

If you want a ready-made Redis lock, `redis-py` ships one: `r.lock(name, timeout=10, blocking_timeout=5)`. It is a single-node lock, not RedLock — fine for the use cases above, not a substitute for a real distributed-lock primitive.

### Solution 2: Probabilistic Early Expiration (XFetch)

Refresh the cache **before** it expires. Each request has a small probability of refreshing early, increasing as TTL approaches 0:

```python
import random

async def get_with_early_refresh(
    r: aioredis.Redis,
    key: str,
    fetch_fn,
    ttl: int = 3600,
    beta: float = 1.0,  # higher = more aggressive early refresh
):
    cached = await r.get(key)
    remaining_ttl = await r.ttl(key)

    if cached and remaining_ttl > 0:
        # Probabilistic early refresh
        # As TTL approaches 0, probability of refresh approaches 1
        if remaining_ttl > ttl * beta * random.random():
            return json.loads(cached)

    # Refresh (either expired or selected for early refresh)
    value = await fetch_fn()
    await r.setex(key, ttl, json.dumps(value))
    return value
```

### Solution 3: Background Refresh

Never let the cache expire. A background task refreshes before TTL runs out:

```python
class BackgroundCacheRefresher:
    """Refreshes cache keys in the background before they expire."""

    def __init__(self, redis_client, refresh_threshold: float = 0.2):
        self.r = redis_client
        self.refresh_threshold = refresh_threshold  # refresh when < 20% TTL remains
        self._loaders: dict[str, tuple[callable, int]] = {}

    def register(self, key: str, loader: callable, ttl: int):
        self._loaders[key] = (loader, ttl)

    async def refresh_loop(self):
        while True:
            for key, (loader, ttl) in self._loaders.items():
                cache_key = f"cache:{key}"
                remaining = await self.r.ttl(cache_key)

                if remaining == -2:
                    # Key does not exist — populate it
                    result = await loader()
                    if result is not None:
                        await self.r.set(cache_key, json.dumps(result), ex=ttl)

                elif remaining < ttl * self.refresh_threshold:
                    # TTL running low — refresh
                    result = await loader()
                    if result is not None:
                        await self.r.set(cache_key, json.dumps(result), ex=ttl)

            await asyncio.sleep(10)  # check every 10 seconds
```

### Which Anti-Stampede Approach to Use

| Approach | Complexity | Best for |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Mutex lock** | Low | Most applications. Simple and effective. |
| **XFetch** | Medium | High-throughput systems. No waiting, no locks. |
| **Background refresh** | Medium | Known set of hot keys. Proactive, no miss ever. |

## Cache Invalidation

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." — Phil Karlton

### Delete on Write (Most Common)

The simplest approach. When you update the database, delete the corresponding cache key.

```python
async def update_user(r: aioredis.Redis, user_id: str, data: dict):
    await db.update_user(user_id, data)
    # Invalidate all related cache keys
    await r.delete(
        f"user:{user_id}",
        f"user:{user_id}:profile",
        f"user:{user_id}:settings",
    )
```

**Why delete, not update?** Deleting avoids the direct last-cache-write-wins race, but it does not
eliminate every stale repopulation race. If two writers are the only actors:

```
With SET (update cache): race condition
Thread A: DB update (name="Alice")
Thread B: DB update (name="Bob")
Thread B: SET cache (name="Bob")
Thread A: SET cache (name="Alice")  <-- STALE! DB has "Bob" but cache has "Alice"

With DELETE: safer for the writer/writer race
Thread A: DB update (name="Alice")
Thread B: DB update (name="Bob")
Thread A: DELETE cache
Thread B: DELETE cache  <-- cache is empty, next read gets fresh "Bob" from DB
```

A reader can still lose a race to the invalidation:

```
Reader: cache MISS; reads old "Alice" from DB
Writer: commits "Bob"; DELETE cache
Reader: SET cache to old "Alice"  <-- stale value reappears after the delete
```

Choose the guarantee explicitly: accept bounded staleness with a short TTL, store a database
version and reject older cache fills, or issue a delayed second invalidation after the longest
expected read/fill interval. A transactional outbox plus versioned invalidation is the usual
choice when stale data would violate a business rule.

### Event-Driven with Pub/Sub

When you have multiple application servers, broadcast invalidation events:

```python
# Writer service
async def update_user(r: aioredis.Redis, user_id: str, data: dict):
    await db.update_user(user_id, data)
    await r.delete(f"user:{user_id}")
    await r.publish("cache:invalidate", json.dumps({"type": "user", "id": user_id}))

# Cache service (subscriber on each app server)
async def invalidation_listener(r: aioredis.Redis):
    pubsub = r.pubsub()
    await pubsub.subscribe("cache:invalidate")
    async for msg in pubsub.listen():
        if msg["type"] == "message":
            event = json.loads(msg["data"])
            if event["type"] == "user":
                await r.delete(f"user:{event['id']}")
                # Also clear local in-memory cache if you have one
```

### Versioned Keys

Instead of invalidating, change the cache key by including a version number. Old keys naturally expire via TTL.

```python
async def get_user_versioned(r, user_id: str) -> Optional[dict]:
    version = await r.get(f"version:user:{user_id}") or "v1"
    cache_key = f"user:{user_id}:{version}"

    cached = await r.get(cache_key)
    if cached is not None:
        return json.loads(cached)

    user = await db.fetch_user(user_id)
    if user:
        await r.set(cache_key, json.dumps(user), ex=300)
    return user

async def update_user_versioned(r, user_id: str, data: dict):
    await db.update_user(user_id, data)
    # Bump version — old cache key becomes orphaned, expires via TTL
    await r.incr(f"version:user:{user_id}")
```

### Tag-Based Invalidation

Group related cache keys under tags. Invalidate all keys in a tag at once.

```python
async def cache_with_tags(r, cache_key: str, tags: list[str], data: str, ttl: int = 300):
    """Store data in cache and associate it with tags."""
    async with r.pipeline() as pipe:
        pipe.set(cache_key, data, ex=ttl)
        for tag in tags:
            pipe.sadd(f"tag:{tag}", cache_key)
            pipe.expire(f"tag:{tag}", ttl + 60)  # tag set outlives its members
        await pipe.execute()

async def invalidate_by_tag(r, tag: str):
    """Delete all cache keys associated with a tag."""
    cache_keys = await r.smembers(f"tag:{tag}")
    if cache_keys:
        async with r.pipeline() as pipe:
            for key in cache_keys:
                pipe.delete(key)
            pipe.delete(f"tag:{tag}")
            await pipe.execute()

# Usage
await cache_with_tags(r, "cache:product:1", ["products", "category:electronics"], product_json)
await cache_with_tags(r, "cache:product:2", ["products", "category:electronics"], product_json)
await cache_with_tags(r, "cache:product:3", ["products", "category:books"], product_json)

# Invalidate all electronics products
await invalidate_by_tag(r, "category:electronics")  # deletes product:1 and product:2
```

### Invalidation Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | How | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-----|------|------|
| **Delete on write** | `r.delete(key)` after DB write | Simple, correct | Cache miss after every write |
| **Update on write** | `r.setex(key, ...)` after DB write | No miss penalty | Write amplification, race conditions |
| **Event-driven** | Pub/sub or CDC triggers invalidation | Decoupled, works across services | More infrastructure |
| **Versioned keys** | `user:123:v5` — increment version on write | Old versions naturally expire | Key proliferation |
| **Tag-based** | Associate keys with tags, invalidate by tag | Bulk invalidation | Requires tracking structure |

## Caching Negative Results (Cache Miss Protection)

What happens when you query for data that does not exist? Without protection, every request for a non-existent user hits the database.

```python
async def get_user_with_negative_cache(r, user_id: str) -> Optional[dict]:
    cache_key = f"user:{user_id}"

    cached = await r.get(cache_key)
    if cached is not None:
        if cached == "__NULL__":
            return None  # cached negative result
        return json.loads(cached)

    user = await db.fetch_user(user_id)

    if user is not None:
        await r.set(cache_key, json.dumps(user), ex=300)
    else:
        # Cache the "not found" result with a shorter TTL
        await r.set(cache_key, "__NULL__", ex=60)

    return user
```

**Why a shorter TTL for negative results?** The data might be created soon. A 60-second TTL means at most 60 seconds of "not found" after creation, while still protecting the DB from repeated lookups of truly non-existent data.

## Summary

> Start with cache-aside + delete-on-write + `allkeys-lru`. Add complexity only when you have evidence you need it.
