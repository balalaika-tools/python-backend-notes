# Redis

> Everything you need to use Redis effectively in Python backends — data structures, messaging patterns, caching strategies, and Python client integration.

Redis is an **in-memory data structure store** that serves data over TCP. It is not just a key-value cache — it provides rich data structures (strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, streams) with atomic operations, making it a versatile tool for caching, messaging, rate limiting, session storage, and real-time analytics.

> **Mental model:** Redis = data structures served over TCP. Pick the right structure for the job, and Redis gives you atomic operations on it at memory speed.

## Learning Path

### New to Redis

**Working result by entry 1**: connect, set one expiring string, read it back, and observe the value
and remaining time to live in the opening baseline of `01`.

1. **Do:** [Data Structures](01_data_structures.md), but stop after the string/hash baseline and expiration trace.
2. **Understand:** [Python Clients](04_python_clients.md) — own one async client and its pool for the application lifetime.

**Stop here if** the application only needs bounded key/value state or caching. Continue into the
relevant branch below; lists, sets, sorted sets, streams, eviction, and the full command lookup are
reference material, not prerequisites.

**Building real-time features** → Read `02` for Pub/Sub and Streams patterns.

**Adding caching to your app** → Read `03` for caching patterns, then `04` for Python client setup.

**Integrating with FastAPI** → Read `04` for connection pooling, dependency injection, and async client patterns.

**Performance / production concerns** → Check eviction policies in `03`, connection pooling in `04`.

**Rate limiting / quota enforcement** → Read `05` for the four canonical algorithms. The application-layer architecture that consumes them lives in [Safe and Scalable API Calls / 09](../../fundamentals/fastapi/safe_and_scalable_api_calls/09_distributed_admission_control.md).

**Running Redis in production (HA, persistence, failover)** → Read `06` before committing to a deployment topology.

## Key Decisions at a Glance

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Redis for caching or messaging? | Both — but understand the trade-offs of each pattern |
| Pub/Sub or Streams? | Pub/Sub for fire-and-forget. Streams when you need durability and consumer groups. |
| Sync or async redis-py? | Async for FastAPI. Sync for scripts and CLI tools. |
| Connection pooling? | Always. Never create a new connection per request. |
| Redis or Kafka? | Redis Streams for moderate throughput. Kafka for massive scale and strict ordering. |
| Eviction policy? | `allkeys-lru` for pure cache. `volatile-lru` if you mix cached and persistent data. |

## Prerequisites

- **Basic Python** — `async`/`await`, context managers, type hints
- **Networking basics** — TCP connections, client-server model, connection pooling
- [Concurrency & Async](../../fundamentals/concurrency/async/01_event_loop_and_tasks.md) — event loops before using async Redis clients
- [FastAPI Dependency Injection](../../fundamentals/fastapi/02_dependency_injection.md) — for the FastAPI integration patterns in `04`
