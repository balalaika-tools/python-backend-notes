## Reading Order

### First Kafka-backed service

**For**: backend engineers who have not operated Kafka before.

**Working result by entry 2**: publish and consume `order.created`, then explain its topic,
partition, offset, and retention independently of the consumer.

1. **Do:** [First event round trip](fundamentals/01_first_event_round_trip.md).
2. **Understand:** [Logs, topics, partitions, and offsets](fundamentals/02_log_topics_partitions_and_offsets.md).
3. **Understand:** [Keys and ordering](fundamentals/03_partitioning_keys_and_ordering.md), then [consumer groups](fundamentals/04_consumer_groups_offsets_and_rebalancing.md).
4. **Build:** [Python producers and consumers](application_design/02_python_producers_and_consumers.md).
5. **Design:** [Event contracts](application_design/01_event_contracts_and_schema_evolution.md) and [topics](application_design/04_topic_and_partition_design.md).

**Stop here if** an internal event flow may tolerate occasional duplicate processing. Continue to
[Reliability](reliability/README.md) when processing changes money, inventory, permissions, or
another external system.

### Production hardening

**For**: engineers taking an existing event flow to production.

**Working result by entry 2**: derive its real delivery guarantee from a crash trace and select an
idempotency boundary.

1. **Do:** [Trace delivery semantics](reliability/01_delivery_semantics.md).
2. **Harden:** [Idempotence and transactions](reliability/02_idempotence_transactions_and_exactly_once.md).
3. **Recover:** [Retries, dead letters, and replay](reliability/03_retries_dead_letters_and_replay.md).
4. **Operate:** [Security](operations/01_security_and_multitenancy.md), [capacity](operations/02_capacity_planning_and_performance.md), and [observability](operations/03_observability_and_incident_response.md).

**Stop here if** the service has bounded lag, idempotent effects, tested replay, and actionable
alerts. Continue to deployment and disaster recovery when your team owns the cluster lifecycle.

### Architecture decision

**For**: engineers deciding whether Kafka belongs in a design.

**Working result by entry 2**: classify the workload as an event log, work queue, stream processor,
or direct integration and reject at least one unsuitable option.

1. **Do:** [When to use Kafka](ecosystem/04_when_to_use_kafka.md).
2. **Understand:** [The retained-log model](fundamentals/02_log_topics_partitions_and_offsets.md).
3. **Branch:** [Share groups](ecosystem/03_share_groups_and_queue_semantics.md), [Connect](ecosystem/01_kafka_connect_and_data_integration.md), or [stream processing](ecosystem/02_stream_processing.md) only when needed.

**Stop here if** a simpler queue, database table, webhook, or direct call satisfies the delivery
contract. Kafka is valuable only when its retained, partitioned log is part of the requirement.

## Prerequisites

- Comfort with processes, network failures, and database transactions.
- [Background work](../../background_work/README.md) is useful when comparing events with durable jobs.
- [Redis Streams](../redis/02_pubsub_and_streams.md) provides a smaller-system comparison.
