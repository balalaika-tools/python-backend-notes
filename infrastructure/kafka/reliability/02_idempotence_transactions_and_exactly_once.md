# Kafka's “Exactly Once” Ends at the Boundary It Can Transact

> **Who this is for**: engineers reviewing duplicate-prevention or exactly-once claims.

## Three mechanisms cover three scopes

| Mechanism | Prevents | Does not prevent |
|---|---|---|
| Producer idempotence | duplicate log appends from one producer retry sequence | duplicate business events sent intentionally |
| Kafka transaction | partial writes across Kafka records and consumed offsets | duplicate effects in an unrelated database or API |
| Consumer idempotency | repeated business effects for a stable key | data loss from committing too early |

## 1. Producer idempotence makes retry sequencing safe

Modern clients enable idempotence when compatible settings remain in force. `acks=all`, retries,
and bounded in-flight requests let the broker reject duplicate sequence numbers. Explicitly verify
effective configuration rather than assuming a framework wrapper preserved it. See the
[Kafka 4.3 producer configuration](https://kafka.apache.org/43/configuration/producer-configs/)
for the exact compatibility constraints.

## 2. Transactions atomically publish Kafka output and offsets

A consume-transform-produce application can write output records and the input group's offsets in
one Kafka transaction. `read_committed` consumers hide aborted transactional records. If the effect
is a card API call, Kafka cannot roll it back; use the provider's idempotency key or a durable local
state transition.

**Success signal:** kill the processor before commit and observe no partial output with
`read_committed`; restart and obtain one committed result. Counting records under the default
isolation silently includes aborted work.

> **Key insight**: exactly-once processing is credible only after naming every state store inside
> the atomic boundary and the strategy for every store outside it.

## 3. What breaks, and when not to use transactions

⚠️ Reusing a transactional ID concurrently fences one producer instance; generating random IDs on
every restart loses the stable identity required for recovery.

Avoid Kafka transactions for simple source producers or external sinks when idempotent writes are
clearer and cheaper.
