# Connection Pooling — Deep Dive

<!-- length-justification: This is the canonical database-pooling decision reference; SQLAlchemy pools, asyncpg pools, PgBouncer modes, sizing, monitoring, and failure symptoms remain together because each consumes the same PostgreSQL connection budget. -->

> **Who this is for**: Backend engineers who already use PostgreSQL connections and need to size, operate, and debug application and proxy pools.

> **Why pooling matters**: Opening a PostgreSQL connection takes ~5-50ms and consumes ~5-10MB of server memory. Without a pool, every request would pay this cost and your database would run out of connections under load.

> **Key insight**: A pool reuses connections but does not create database capacity; every application and proxy layer must fit inside the same server-side connection budget.

## 1. What Is a Connection Pool?

A connection pool is a cache of pre-opened database connections. When your code needs a connection, it borrows one from the pool. When done, it returns it — the connection stays open for the next request.

```
Without pool:
  Request → open connection (5-50ms) → query → close connection → repeat

With pool:
  App start → open 5 connections → keep them
  Request → borrow connection (0ms) → query → return to pool → repeat
```

The pool is the single most important performance optimization for database-backed applications.

---

## 2. SQLAlchemy's Built-in Pool

SQLAlchemy manages its own connection pool. You configure it when creating the engine.

### Pool Types

| Pool Class | Behavior | Use case |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| `QueuePool` (default) | Fixed size + overflow | Web applications |
| `NullPool` | No pooling — new connection per request | Alembic migrations, serverless |
| `StaticPool` | One shared connection, never closed | SQLite in-memory for testing |
| `AssertionPool` | Raises if more than one connection at a time | Debugging |
| `AsyncAdaptedQueuePool` | Async version of QueuePool | Async SQLAlchemy (default) |

### Parameters

```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine

engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    # Pool size
    pool_size=10,          # connections kept open always (steady state)
    max_overflow=20,       # extra connections created under load
                           # total max = pool_size + max_overflow = 30
    # Timeouts
    pool_timeout=30,       # seconds to wait when pool is exhausted (raises TimeoutError)
    # Reliability
    pool_pre_ping=True,    # test connection liveness before checkout
    pool_recycle=3600,     # recycle connections after N seconds (prevents stale connections)
    # Debugging
    echo_pool=False,       # True logs pool events (checkouts, checkins, creates)
)
```

### What Each Setting Does

#### `pool_size`

The number of connections held open at all times. Even with no traffic, the pool keeps `pool_size` connections open.

```
pool_size=5 means:
  App startup → connect 0 connections (lazy)
  First 5 requests arrive → create 5 connections
  Requests complete → 5 connections stay open, idle
  New request arrives → reuse an idle connection instantly
```

#### `max_overflow`

Additional connections created when all `pool_size` connections are checked out.

```
pool_size=5, max_overflow=10:
  Connections 1-5: from pool_size (permanent, never closed unless recycled)
  Connections 6-15: overflow (created on demand, closed when returned)
  Connection 16+: caller blocks until pool_timeout, then TimeoutError
```

#### `pool_timeout`

How long to wait for a connection when the pool is exhausted. Under extreme load:

```python
# Low timeout — fail fast rather than queue
pool_timeout=5   # good for user-facing APIs (better to 503 than wait 30s)

# High timeout — queue requests
pool_timeout=60  # for batch jobs that can wait
```

#### `pool_pre_ping`

Before handing a connection to your code, SQLAlchemy sends `SELECT 1`. If the connection is dead (server restart, network drop, cloud proxy killed it), it creates a fresh one.

```
Without pre_ping:
  Connection goes stale after idle → next query fails with "connection lost"

With pre_ping:
  Stale connection detected → discarded → fresh connection used → query succeeds
```

Cost: one extra round-trip per checkout (~0.1ms). Worth it for any production deployment.

#### `pool_recycle`

Connections are forcibly closed and recreated after this many seconds. Needed for:
- Cloud SQL proxies that kill long-lived connections
- PgBouncer session mode (if idle connections time out)
- Any database with a `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`

```python
pool_recycle=1800   # 30 minutes — good default
pool_recycle=3600   # 1 hour
pool_recycle=-1     # never recycle (default — dangerous in some environments)
```

---

## 3. Pool Sizing Math

Getting pool size wrong causes two failure modes:
- **Too small**: requests queue up waiting for connections → high latency
- **Too large**: exhausts database `max_connections` → connections refused

### The Formula

```
max_connections (PostgreSQL) = pool_size + max_overflow
total_connections_used       = per_instance_max × number_of_app_instances

total_connections_used < max_connections × 0.9  (leave 10% headroom)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation

**Step 1**: Check your PostgreSQL `max_connections`:

```sql
SHOW max_connections;  -- default: 100
```

**Step 2**: Reserve connections for monitoring and admin:

```
Reserved = 5-10 connections (psql access, monitoring agents, etc.)
Available = 100 - 10 = 90
```

**Step 3**: Divide by number of app instances:

```
App instances (pods/workers) = 4
Per-instance budget = 90 / 4 = 22 connections
```

**Step 4**: Set pool_size and max_overflow:

```python
pool_size=5      # steady state (comfortable idle)
max_overflow=15  # burst capacity (total = 20, under the budget of 22)
```

### Environment Profiles

**Development (local):**

```python
create_async_engine(url, pool_size=2, max_overflow=3, pool_pre_ping=True)
```

**Low-traffic service (1-2 instances):**

```python
create_async_engine(
    url,
    pool_size=5,
    max_overflow=10,
    pool_pre_ping=True,
    pool_recycle=1800,
)
```

**Standard API (4-8 instances, DB max_connections=100):**

```python
# Per instance: 100 / 4 instances = 25 max, use 20 for safety
create_async_engine(
    url,
    pool_size=10,
    max_overflow=10,
    pool_pre_ping=True,
    pool_recycle=3600,
    pool_timeout=30,
)
```

**High-traffic API (10+ instances, DB max_connections=500):**

```python
# Per instance: 500 / 10 = 50, use 40 for safety
create_async_engine(
    url,
    pool_size=15,
    max_overflow=25,
    pool_pre_ping=True,
    pool_recycle=1800,
    pool_timeout=10,  # fail fast under extreme load
)
```

### Kubernetes Considerations

In Kubernetes, `max_overflow` matters more because the number of pods can vary:

```python
import os

POOL_SIZE = int(os.getenv("DB_POOL_SIZE", "5"))
MAX_OVERFLOW = int(os.getenv("DB_MAX_OVERFLOW", "10"))

engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    pool_size=POOL_SIZE,
    max_overflow=MAX_OVERFLOW,
    pool_pre_ping=True,
)
```

Configure via environment variables so you can tune without code changes.

## 4. PgBouncer — External Connection Pooler

SQLAlchemy's pool manages connections **within a single process**. Under heavy load with many app instances, you can exhaust PostgreSQL's `max_connections` even with small per-instance pools.

**PgBouncer** sits between your app and PostgreSQL, multiplexing connections:

```
App Instance 1 (pool: 10 conns)  ─┐
App Instance 2 (pool: 10 conns)  ─┤→ PgBouncer (10 server conns) → PostgreSQL
App Instance 3 (pool: 10 conns)  ─┘
App Instance 4 (pool: 10 conns)

Without PgBouncer: 40 PostgreSQL connections
With PgBouncer:    10 PostgreSQL connections
```

### PgBouncer Modes

| Mode | How it works | Connection overhead | Use case |
|------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Transaction** (recommended) | Server connection assigned per transaction | Lowest — reuses aggressively | Most web apps |
| **Session** | Server connection held for client's lifetime | Moderate | Apps using session-scoped features (advisory locks, SET LOCAL) |
| **Statement** | Server connection per statement | Lowest overhead | Read-only apps only — no multi-statement transactions |

**Transaction mode** is almost always the right choice. It means 100+ app connections can share 10-20 PostgreSQL connections, as long as they're not all in a transaction simultaneously.

### PgBouncer Configuration (pgbouncer.ini)

```ini
[databases]
mydb = host=postgres-server port=5432 dbname=mydb

[pgbouncer]
listen_port = 6432
listen_addr = 0.0.0.0
auth_type = md5
auth_file = /etc/pgbouncer/userlist.txt

pool_mode = transaction
default_pool_size = 20       # server connections per database/user pair
max_client_conn = 1000       # max simultaneous client connections
min_pool_size = 5            # minimum server connections to keep
reserve_pool_size = 5        # extra connections for bursts
reserve_pool_timeout = 5     # seconds before using reserve pool
server_idle_timeout = 600    # close idle server connections after 10 min
client_idle_timeout = 0      # never close idle client connections
```

### Connecting Through PgBouncer

```python
from sqlalchemy.pool import NullPool

# Point your connection string at PgBouncer instead of PostgreSQL directly
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@pgbouncer-host:6432/mydb"

# With PgBouncer transaction mode, make two measured choices:
#   1. Don't double-pool: let PgBouncer be the pool (NullPool, or a tiny QueuePool).
#   2. Match prepared-statement behavior to PgBouncer's max_prepared_statements setting.
engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    poolclass=NullPool,                       # no internal pool — PgBouncer pools instead
    connect_args={"statement_cache_size": 0}, # conservative for an unconfigured/older proxy
)

# Note: NullPool and pool_size/max_overflow are mutually exclusive — NullPool ignores
# size args. If you prefer a tiny pool instead of NullPool, drop poolclass and use:
#     pool_size=2, max_overflow=5, pool_pre_ping=True
# and verify pool wait/client-connection cost before choosing either topology.
```

**Why use `NullPool` or a tiny pool with PgBouncer?**

In transaction mode, PgBouncer releases the **server** connection after each transaction even while
SQLAlchemy retains the client-side connection to PgBouncer. Choose `NullPool` or a small client pool
to control client-connection cost, queueing, and prepared-statement cleanup—not because an idle
client connection pins a server connection. Measure both layers under the real topology.

### PgBouncer Limitations

In transaction mode, behavior depends on whether state is transaction-local or session-local:

| Feature | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| `SET LOCAL` | Works inside the current transaction |
| `SET SESSION` | Unsafe because a later transaction may use another server session |
| Transaction advisory locks (`pg_advisory_xact_lock`) | Work inside one transaction |
| Session advisory locks (`pg_advisory_lock`) | Unsafe because ownership is session-scoped |
| `NOTIFY` | Works as a statement; delivery is committed with the transaction |
| `LISTEN` | Unsafe because registration is session-scoped |
| Temporary tables (`CREATE TEMP TABLE`) | Session-scoped |
| Protocol-level named prepared statements | Supported only when PgBouncer prepared-statement tracking is enabled and sized |
| SQL `PREPARE` / `DEALLOCATE` | Session-scoped and not rewritten by PgBouncer |
| Cursors outside transactions | Session-scoped |

For prepared statements with asyncpg through PgBouncer:

```python
# Conservative option for an older or unconfigured PgBouncer: disable both caches.
engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL + "?prepared_statement_cache_size=0",  # asyncpg dialect DBAPI option
    connect_args={"statement_cache_size": 0},     # asyncpg-level
)
```

Current PgBouncer can track protocol-level named prepared statements when
`max_prepared_statements` is nonzero. If that feature is enabled, keep caching and use unique
statement names as required by the SQLAlchemy asyncpg dialect. Verify with repeated transactions
through PgBouncer; success is stable execution without `DuplicatePreparedStatementError` or
`InvalidSQLStatementNameError` after connections are reassigned.

For psycopg3:

```python
engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    connect_args={"prepare_threshold": None},  # disable auto-prepare
)
```

---

## 5. asyncpg's Built-in Pool

asyncpg has its own pool, independent of SQLAlchemy. Use this when you're using asyncpg directly (without SQLAlchemy).

```python
import asyncpg

pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
    dsn="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb",
    min_size=5,                          # always keep this many connections open
    max_size=20,                         # never more than this
    max_inactive_connection_lifetime=300, # close idle connections after 5 min
    command_timeout=30,                  # default timeout for all queries
    max_queries=50000,                   # recycle connection after N queries
    setup=setup_connection,              # called on each new connection
)
```

### Per-Connection Setup Hook

Use the `setup` parameter to configure each connection when it's created:

```python
async def setup_connection(conn):
    # Set default timezone
    await conn.execute("SET TIME ZONE 'UTC'")
    # Set statement timeout
    await conn.execute("SET statement_timeout = '30s'")
    # Register custom type codecs
    await conn.set_type_codec(
        "jsonb",
        encoder=json.dumps,
        decoder=json.loads,
        schema="pg_catalog",
    )

pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(dsn=DSN, setup=setup_connection)
```

---

## 6. Monitoring the Pool

### SQLAlchemy Pool Events

```python
from sqlalchemy import event
from sqlalchemy.pool import Pool
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("sqlalchemy.pool")

@event.listens_for(Pool, "checkout")
def on_checkout(dbapi_conn, connection_record, connection_proxy):
    logger.debug("Connection checked out from pool")

@event.listens_for(Pool, "checkin")
def on_checkin(dbapi_conn, connection_record):
    logger.debug("Connection returned to pool")

@event.listens_for(Pool, "connect")
def on_connect(dbapi_conn, connection_record):
    logger.info("New database connection created")

@event.listens_for(Pool, "invalidate")
def on_invalidate(dbapi_conn, connection_record, exception):
    logger.warning("Database connection invalidated", exc_info=exception)
```

### Pool Status

```python
# Get pool statistics
pool = engine.pool
print(f"Pool size: {pool.size()}")
print(f"Checked out: {pool.checkedout()}")
print(f"Overflow: {pool.overflow()}")
print(f"Checked in: {pool.checkedin()}")
```

Expose these as metrics (Prometheus, Datadog):

```python
from prometheus_client import Gauge

db_pool_size = Gauge("db_pool_size", "Pool size")
db_pool_checked_out = Gauge("db_pool_checked_out", "Checked out connections")
db_pool_overflow = Gauge("db_pool_overflow", "Overflow connections")

async def update_pool_metrics():
    pool = engine.pool
    db_pool_size.set(pool.size())
    db_pool_checked_out.set(pool.checkedout())
    db_pool_overflow.set(pool.overflow())
```

### PostgreSQL-Side Monitoring

```sql
-- Active connections per application
SELECT application_name, state, count(*)
FROM pg_stat_activity
GROUP BY application_name, state
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Long-running queries (potential connection hogs)
SELECT pid, now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration, query, state
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state != 'idle' AND query_start < now() - interval '30 seconds'
ORDER BY duration DESC;

-- Connections approaching max
SELECT count(*) AS active,
       max_conn,
       count(*) * 100 / max_conn AS pct_used
FROM pg_stat_activity,
     (SELECT setting::int AS max_conn FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'max_connections') x
GROUP BY max_conn;

```

Termination rolls back the target's open transaction and disconnects its client. First use the
read-only query above to identify an exact application PID and verify its database, user,
`backend_type`, state, query, and duration. Never target the current session, an administrator, or a
replication/background worker. Then run the bounded destructive step with that verified literal:

```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(12345) AS terminated
WHERE 12345 <> pg_backend_pid()
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_stat_activity
    WHERE pid = 12345
      AND backend_type = 'client backend'
      AND usename = 'myapp'
      AND datname = 'myapp'
  );
-- terminated = true means PostgreSQL sent termination; zero rows means the guard refused it.
```

## 7. Connection Pool Failure Modes

### Pool Exhaustion

**Symptom**: `TimeoutError: QueuePool limit of size N overflow N reached, connection timed out`

**Causes**:
- Long-running queries holding connections
- Missing `await session.close()` / not using context managers
- Sudden traffic spike
- Pool size too small for the workload

**Fixes**:
```python
# 1. Always use context managers — they guarantee return to pool
async with async_session() as session:
    ...  # session returned even on exception

# 2. Set statement timeout to prevent runaway queries
engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    connect_args={"server_settings": {"statement_timeout": "30000"}},
)

# 3. Increase pool size if the workload genuinely needs more connections
# 4. Set query timeouts to prevent connection hogging
```

When the server cancels a statement at this boundary, asyncpg surfaces SQLSTATE `57014`
(`query_canceled`); that is the signal that the server setting, rather than a pool wait, fired.

### Stale Connections (without pre_ping)

**Symptom**: `OperationalError: SSL connection has been closed unexpectedly` or `server closed the connection unexpectedly`

**Cause**: Cloud databases (RDS, Cloud SQL) and proxies silently close idle connections after a timeout.

**Fix**: `pool_pre_ping=True` — always.

### Connection Leak

**Symptom**: Pool exhausts even with low traffic. Connection count slowly grows. Restart fixes it temporarily.

**Cause**: Code path that acquires a session but never releases it:

```python
# ❌ Connection leak
session = async_session()
result = await session.execute(select(User))
# exception here — session never closed!

# ✅ No leak — context manager guarantees cleanup
async with async_session() as session:
    result = await session.execute(select(User))
    # session closed on exit even if exception
```

**Detection**:

```sql
-- Find connections that have been idle in a transaction for > 5 minutes
SELECT pid, state, now() - xact_start AS tx_duration, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'idle in transaction'
AND xact_start < now() - interval '5 minutes';
```

### Thundering Herd on Startup

**Symptom**: App startup causes a spike of connection attempts that overwhelm the database.

**Fix**: SQLAlchemy creates connections lazily by default (first use, not startup). For asyncpg's own pool:

```python
pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
    dsn=DSN,
    min_size=0,   # start with 0 connections, create on first request
    max_size=20,
)
```

---

## 8. Statement and Query Timeouts

Always set timeouts to prevent slow queries from holding connections and blocking the pool.

### PostgreSQL Statement Timeout

```python
# Set per-connection at creation time
engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    connect_args={"options": "-c statement_timeout=30000"},  # 30 seconds (ms)
)

# Set per-query via SQL
async with session.begin():
    await session.execute(text("SET LOCAL statement_timeout = '5s'"))
    # expensive query here — will raise if it takes > 5s
```

### Lock Timeout

Prevent queries from waiting indefinitely for a lock:

```python
engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    connect_args={"options": "-c lock_timeout=5000"},  # 5 seconds
)
```

### Idle in Transaction Timeout

Prevent transactions from staying open indefinitely (a common connection leak source):

```python
engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    connect_args={"options": "-c idle_in_transaction_session_timeout=60000"},  # 60s
)
```

### asyncpg Command Timeout

```python
pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
    dsn=DSN,
    command_timeout=30,  # default timeout for all queries (seconds)
)

# Per-query timeout
row = await pool.fetchrow("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", user_id, timeout=5.0)
```

---

## 9. Production Checklist

```
Pool Configuration:
  ✅ pool_pre_ping=True — always, prevents stale connection errors
  ✅ pool_size + max_overflow < DB max_connections / num_instances
  ✅ pool_recycle set if using cloud DB, PgBouncer, or proxies
  ✅ pool_timeout set (prefer fast failure over long queues)
  ✅ statement_timeout set — prevents runaway queries

Code Patterns:
  ✅ Always use context managers for sessions (async with async_session() as s)
  ✅ One session per request, never shared between requests
  ✅ Engine created once at module level, never per-request
  ✅ engine.dispose() called on shutdown (lifespan context manager)

Monitoring:
  ✅ Pool metrics exposed (size, checked_out, overflow)
  ✅ Alerts on pool exhaustion (checked_out approaching max)
  ✅ Alerts on long-running queries (pg_stat_activity)
  ✅ Alerts on idle-in-transaction connections

PgBouncer (if used):
  ✅ Transaction mode (unless you use session-scoped features)
  ✅ Prepared statement cache disabled in driver
  ✅ SQLAlchemy pool minimized (NullPool or pool_size=1-2)
```
