## What Problem Does It Solve?

Every app needs to answer two questions:
1. **Who is this user?** (authentication)
2. **What can they do?** (authorization)

Building this yourself means: a user database, password hashing, email verification, MFA, token generation, token validation, session management, forgot-password flows, brute-force protection... Cognito handles all of that.

---

## The Two Services

Cognito has two completely separate services that solve different problems. Don't confuse them.

### User Pools — "Who is this user?"

A **User Pool** is a managed user directory + authentication engine. It stores your users and handles logging them in.

Think of it as: *your own private auth system running on AWS*.

When a user successfully logs in, the User Pool issues **JWT tokens** (cryptographically signed JSON). Your app and your API use these tokens to know who the user is and what they're allowed to do.

### Identity Pools — "What AWS services can this user touch directly?"

An **Identity Pool** takes a token (from a User Pool, Google, Facebook, SAML, etc.) and exchanges it for **temporary AWS credentials** (via STS).

Use this only when your frontend needs to call AWS services directly — like uploading to S3 from a browser. If all your AWS calls go through your own backend, you don't need an Identity Pool.

**In most web/mobile apps, you only need a User Pool.**

---

## Two Kinds of Policies — The Common Confusion

People often wonder: *"If my user has permissions, doesn't AWS need to know about them somewhere?"*

Not necessarily. There are two completely separate places where policies live:

### 1) App policies / business rules (no Identity Pool needed)

Examples: admin sees all invoices, user sees only their own, manager can approve requests.

These live in your **backend code**, not in AWS IAM. The backend reads the User Pool JWT and applies its own logic:

```
Frontend  →  JWT in Authorization header  →  Your Backend
                                               ↓
                                          validate token
                                          read cognito:groups or other claims
                                          apply your own rules
                                          talk to S3/DynamoDB with the backend's own IAM role
```

The user never has AWS credentials — only a JWT. The backend has the IAM role. This is **"User Pool for auth, backend for authorization"** — the standard pattern.

```python
claims = validate_token(token)
groups = claims.get("cognito:groups", [])

if "admin" in groups:
    # show all invoices
elif claims["sub"] == requested_user_id:
    # show only their own
else:
    raise PermissionError("Forbidden")
```

### 2) IAM policies for direct AWS resource access (needs Identity Pool)

Examples: browser uploads directly to S3, frontend reads DynamoDB directly without a backend.

Here the user needs actual AWS credentials. The Identity Pool exchanges the User Pool JWT for **temporary AWS credentials** (via STS). Those credentials carry IAM policies that govern what AWS resources the user can touch directly.

```
Frontend  →  User Pool JWT  →  Identity Pool  →  STS  →  temporary AWS credentials
                                                              ↓
                                                     frontend calls S3 directly with those creds
```

### The bottom line

| Scenario | Where policies live | Needs Identity Pool? |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Backend enforces what the user can do | JWT claims + your code | No |
| Frontend calls AWS services directly | IAM policies via STS | Yes |

If all AWS calls go through your backend, the user never needs IAM credentials. Your backend reads the JWT, decides what's allowed, and uses **its own** IAM role to talk to AWS.

```

**Step by step:**
1. User enters email + password in your app
2. Your app calls Cognito with: `client_id` + credentials
3. Cognito checks: valid client? valid credentials? MFA required?
4. Cognito returns three JWT tokens
5. Your app stores these tokens (memory, cookies, secure storage)
6. On every API request, your app sends: `Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>`
7. Your API validates the token's signature against Cognito's public keys
8. When the AccessToken expires (default: 1 hour), your app silently uses the RefreshToken to get new tokens — user never notices

---

## The Key Components

### User Pool
The container. Holds your users and all configuration for how authentication works. You have one (or a few) user pools. All users of your application live here.

**Pool-level settings:**
- Password policies
- MFA requirements
- Email/SMS verification
- Account recovery flows
- Lambda triggers
- Which attributes users have (email, name, custom fields)

### App Client
**This is the part people find confusing.**

An App Client is a registration of one of your applications with the User Pool. It answers: *which app is making this login request, and what is that app allowed to do?*

Every login request includes a `client_id`. Cognito looks up that client_id to know which App Client configuration to apply.

**Why does this exist?**

One User Pool, multiple apps. Example:
- Your **web app** — allows social login (Google, Facebook), uses authorization code flow, tokens expire in 1 hour
- Your **mobile app** — only allows SRP auth (no social login), tokens expire in 30 days
- Your **internal admin tool** — requires MFA, shorter token lifetime, different OAuth scopes
- Your **backend service** — uses client credentials (machine-to-machine, no user login at all)

All four share the **same user database** (User Pool) but each has its own App Client with different rules.

**App Client has:**
- `client_id` — always present, identifies the client
- `client_secret` — optional, only for server-side apps (never put in browser/mobile code)
- Which auth flows are enabled (`USER_SRP_AUTH`, `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`, etc.)
- Token validity durations (AccessToken, IdToken, RefreshToken)
- OAuth scopes it can request
- Which attributes it can read/write

> Rule of thumb: **no client secret for browser or mobile apps** (it would be exposed). Client secret only for server-side code.

### Groups
Optional. You can put users in groups (e.g. `admins`, `premium`, `free-tier`). Group membership is included in the JWT tokens as the `cognito:groups` claim. Your backend reads that claim to make authorization decisions.

```python
# In your API, after decoding the JWT:
groups = decoded_token.get('cognito:groups', [])
if 'admins' not in groups:
    raise PermissionError("Admin only")
```

### Lambda Triggers
Hooks that fire at specific points in the auth lifecycle. Let you customize behavior without forking Cognito. See [user-pool.md](./user-pool.md) for the full list.

## The Tokens

Three tokens come back on successful login:

| Token | What it is | What it's for | Default TTL |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **IdToken** | JWT with user info (email, name, groups) | "Who is this user?" — identity | 1 hour |
| **AccessToken** | JWT with scopes and permissions | Authorize API calls | 1 hour |
| **RefreshToken** | Encrypted opaque string | Get new Id/Access tokens silently | 30 days |

See [tokens.md](./tokens.md) for deep detail on JWT structure, validation, and the refresh flow.

## What You Build vs What Cognito Handles

| You build | Cognito handles |
|-----------|----------------|
| Login UI (form, buttons) | Password hashing and storage |
| Sending tokens on API requests | Email/SMS verification codes |

## Pricing & Free Tier (Plan This Early)

Cognito pricing scales per **Monthly Active User (MAU)**, not per request. A user is "active" if any auth operation happens on them in the month (login, token refresh, sign-up, etc.).

As of August 2026, user pools come in three feature tiers, each priced differently. Pick the tier that matches the features you need — advanced security and managed-login branding require Essentials or Plus:

- **Lite** — basic auth. **10,000 direct/social MAU free**, then roughly **$0.0055/MAU** for the first paid band, cheaper at scale.
- **Essentials** — adds managed login branding, advanced threat protection options, etc. **10,000 MAU free**, then ~**$0.015/MAU**.
- **Plus** — adds full advanced security (compromised-credential checks, adaptive auth). **Charges from the first MAU**, highest per-MAU rate.

Always confirm current rates and tier features at <https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/pricing/> — these numbers move.

- **SAML / OIDC federation** users are priced separately: only **50 MAU free**, then ~$0.015/MAU above that.
- **Machine-to-machine tokens** (client_credentials) are priced per token request, not per MAU, since there's no "user" to be monthly-active.

For planning: a 100k-MAU app on the **Lite** tier has about 90,000 billable MAUs after the current free allowance. At a hypothetical flat `$0.0055/MAU`, that would be `90,000 × $0.0055 ≈ $495/month`; the real bill must use AWS's current graduated rates. The same app on Essentials/Plus costs substantially more — size the tier *and* the volume before the invoice appears.

---

## Federation — Social Login and Enterprise SSO

Cognito can federate identity from external providers. Two categories:

### Social federation (consumer apps)

Built-in providers (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Sign-in-with-Apple) + any generic OIDC provider. The flow:

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" in your app.
2. Your app redirects to the Cognito Hosted UI with `identity_provider=Google`.
3. Cognito redirects to Google for the OAuth dance.
4. Google sends the user back to Cognito with an auth code; Cognito exchanges it for the user's info.
5. Cognito either **creates a new user in your pool** (first time) or looks up the existing linked user, then issues **your pool's** JWTs (not Google's).

The important property: your backend only ever sees Cognito-issued tokens. It validates them using the same JWKS as password-authenticated users — no per-provider code. Federation is configured declaratively on the user pool.

```python
cognito_client.create_identity_provider(
    UserPoolId=POOL_ID,
    ProviderName='Google',
    ProviderType='Google',
    ProviderDetails={
        'client_id': '...',
        'client_secret': '...',
        'authorize_scopes': 'openid email profile',
    },
    AttributeMapping={
        'email': 'email',
        'given_name': 'given_name',
    },
)
```

### SAML / OIDC federation (enterprise SSO)

For B2B apps where customers' employees log in via their own IdP (Okta, Azure AD, Ping). Same mechanism: configure a SAML provider in your user pool (upload the customer's IdP metadata XML); your app routes "Sign in with Corp SSO" buttons to the Cognito hosted UI with the right `identity_provider`; Cognito handles the SAML handshake; users land in your pool with claims mapped from SAML attributes.

Federation keeps your code the same — the complexity moves to pool configuration. Budget for tenant provisioning and for claim-mapping edge cases (IdPs disagree on attribute names).

---

## ALB ↔ Cognito Native Integration

If your API runs behind an AWS Application Load Balancer, you can **offload authentication to the ALB itself**. ALB handles the OAuth dance with Cognito, sets a session cookie, and forwards authenticated requests to your origin with the user's identity in a signed header.

```
Browser  →  ALB (authenticates via Cognito)  →  Your FastAPI pod
                ↑                                       ↓
            sets cookie                          reads x-amzn-oidc-data header
```

- ALB listener rule "Action → Authenticate (Cognito)". ALB redirects unauthenticated requests to the Cognito hosted UI.
- On successful auth, ALB sets an AWS-signed session cookie and forwards the request with an `x-amzn-oidc-data` header containing a signed JWT with the user's claims.
- Your origin **still validates the JWT** (the signing key is at a well-known ALB URL) — don't trust the header without verification.

**Pros:** no login code in your app, one fewer auth round trip per request (ALB caches the session), can add auth to legacy apps without touching code.

**Cons:** browser-centric — API clients (mobile, CLI, S2S) still need direct Cognito tokens. Only one Cognito configuration per listener rule — multi-tenant setups with per-tenant Cognito pools don't fit cleanly.

When ALB-Cognito fits (web-only SaaS with one Cognito pool), it's genuinely less code to maintain.
