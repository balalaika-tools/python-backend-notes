## What this section teaches

Concurrency is about handling multiple things in progress. Parallelism is about executing multiple things at the same time. Python gives you several tools, and good backend engineers know the tradeoff:

- `asyncio` coordinates many I/O waits with low per-task overhead.
- Threads integrate blocking libraries and share memory inside one process.
- Processes run CPU-heavy Python in parallel and isolate memory.
- Subinterpreters and free-threaded builds offer advanced parallel runtimes with compatibility costs.
- Context variables carry small request metadata safely through async call chains.
- Locks, queues, semaphores, and message passing make shared state deliberate.

The goal is not to memorize every API. The goal is to design systems that remain fast, bounded, observable, and correct under load.

## Reading order

| Order | Guide | Why it exists |
|------:|-------|---------------|
| 1 | [00_decision_guide.md](00_decision_guide.md) | Choose async, threads, processes, subinterpreters, or job queues. |
| 2 | [01_state_and_safety.md](01_state_and_safety.md) | Understand mutable objects, shared state, thread safety, async safety, and process boundaries. |
| 3 | [async/](async/README.md) | Event loops, coroutines, structured task ownership, admission control, timeouts, cancellation, queues, and `contextvars`. |
| 4 | [threads/](threads/README.md) | `ThreadPoolExecutor`, thread primitives, synchronization patterns, blocking I/O, shared memory, and deadlocks. |
| 5 | [processes/](processes/README.md) | `ProcessPoolExecutor`, pickling, process start methods, CPU parallelism, and process-safe sharing. |
| 6 | [02_alternative_runtimes.md](02_alternative_runtimes.md) | After a default branch works, evaluate Python 3.14 subinterpreters and optional free-threaded CPython. |

After the decision guide, go directly to the async, thread, or process branch it selects. Stop when
that branch's first example produces its named result. Continue to state safety only when work
shares mutable data or crosses scheduler boundaries, and evaluate alternative runtimes only when
measured CPU or isolation needs justify a non-default runtime.

## Quick chooser

| Problem | First tool to consider | Why |
|---------|------------------------|-----|
| A bounded set of HTTP calls with async clients | `asyncio` + `TaskGroup` + capacity limit | Low overhead, structured task ownership, and cooperative cancellation. |
| A large or streaming set of async jobs | Fixed workers + bounded `asyncio.Queue` | Bounds both allocated tasks and waiting work. |
| Many HTTP calls with blocking clients | `ThreadPoolExecutor` or `asyncio.to_thread()` | Blocking calls move off the event loop. |
| Pure Python CPU-heavy loops | `ProcessPoolExecutor` | Separate interpreters avoid the GIL. |
| NumPy, PyTorch, zlib, OpenCV work | Threads can work if the extension releases the GIL | The C extension may run in parallel. Measure it. |
| Python 3.14 CPU work with isolated, compatible dependencies | Benchmark `InterpreterPoolExecutor` | Separate interpreter GILs allow multi-core execution in one process. |
| Per-request logging context | `contextvars.ContextVar` | Isolated per async task, unlike module globals. |
| Cross-process worker jobs | Dramatiq, Celery, RQ, or another queue | Durable retries, isolation, and horizontal scaling. |
| Shared mutable in-memory cache | Threads + locks, or externalize to Redis | Shared memory needs synchronization. |
| Multi-pod global concurrency limit | Redis/database/token service | Local semaphores only protect one process. |

## Command cheat sheet

```bash
# Python and runtime
python -VV
python -c "import os; print('cpu_count=', os.cpu_count()); print('process_cpu_count=', getattr(os, 'process_cpu_count', os.cpu_count)())"
python -c "import multiprocessing as mp; print(mp.get_start_method())"

# Free-threaded build checks, available on modern CPython builds
python -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_config_var('Py_GIL_DISABLED'))"
python -c "import sys; print(getattr(sys, '_is_gil_enabled', lambda: 'unknown')())"

# Async debugging
PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG=1 python app.py
python -X dev app.py
python -m asyncio

# Unix process checks
ps -o pid,ppid,stat,comm -p <PID>
lsof -p <PID>
kill -TERM <PID>
```

Use optional profilers when the code is slow and you need proof:

```bash
py-spy top --pid <PID>
py-spy dump --pid <PID>
```

## Production rules

1. Bound active work and define how much waiting work may be admitted.
2. Put an end-to-end deadline and driver-level phase timeouts on external calls.
3. Do not block the event loop with sync I/O, `time.sleep()`, or CPU loops.
4. Do not share mutable state unless the sharing model is explicit.
5. Use `contextvars` for request context, not module globals or `threading.local()` in async code.
6. Keep process-pool callables top-level and picklable.
7. Treat cancellation and shutdown as part of the design, not cleanup afterthoughts.
8. Remember that cancelling a future usually does not stop thread/process work already running.
9. Measure latency, throughput, memory, saturation, and failure behavior under realistic load.
