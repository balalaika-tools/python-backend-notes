# Part 8: Advanced Streaming Patterns

<!-- length-justification: This deep-dive is the canonical owner for multi-provider stream coordination; fan-out, winner cleanup, aggregation, admission, and the composed endpoint remain together because resource ownership crosses each mechanism. -->

> **Who this is for**: Engineers coordinating multiple long-lived upstream streams after basic
> streaming and cancellation are understood.

> **Principle**: Streaming complexity grows with fan-out, aggregation, and failure handling.

> **Key insight**: Advanced stream coordination requires explicit ownership of every response,
> task, cursor, and client-visible error.

## 1. Stream Multiplexing: Multiple Concurrent Streams

### Use Case

User sends one request, you need to:
- Call multiple LLMs in parallel
- Stream results as they arrive
- Merge into single response stream

### Pattern: First-Response-Wins Streaming

```python
import asyncio
import sys
from typing import AsyncIterator


async def stream_first_responder(
    payload: dict,
    providers: list[str],
) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
    """
    Start streams to multiple providers, yield from first to respond.
    Cancel others once we commit to one.
    """
    
    tasks = [
        asyncio.create_task(get_first_chunk(provider, payload))
        for provider in providers
    ]
    winner_stream = None

    try:
        # A completed failure is not a winner; keep waiting until one provider
        # yields a first chunk or every provider fails.
        for completed in asyncio.as_completed(tasks):
            try:
                _, first_chunk, winner_stream = await completed
            except Exception:
                continue

            yield first_chunk
            async for chunk in winner_stream:
                yield chunk
            return

        raise RuntimeError("all providers failed before producing a chunk")
    finally:
        # Multiple providers can finish in the same event-loop turn. Canceling
        # only pending tasks would leak the already-open streams of completed
        # nonwinners, so collect every result and close every stream.
        for task in tasks:
            if not task.done():
                task.cancel()
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        for result in results:
            if isinstance(result, tuple):
                _, _, opened_stream = result
                await opened_stream.aclose()


async def get_first_chunk(provider: str, payload: dict):
    """
    Start stream, return first chunk + continuation.

    Note: the continuation generator must keep the response context manager
    open for the lifetime of the stream. We enter the context manager here
    and close it explicitly when the generator is exhausted or cancelled.
    """
    cm = client.stream(...)
    response = await cm.__aenter__()

    try:
        first_chunk = None
        async for chunk in response.aiter_lines():
            first_chunk = chunk
            break
    except BaseException:
        await cm.__aexit__(*sys.exc_info())
        raise

    async def continuation():
        try:
            async for chunk in response.aiter_lines():
                yield chunk
        finally:
            await cm.__aexit__(None, None, None)

    return provider, first_chunk, continuation()
```

## 2. Stream Aggregation: Merging Multiple Streams

### Use Case

Query multiple sources, merge results into single stream:
- Search across multiple databases
- Aggregate from multiple AI models
- Real-time data from multiple feeds

### Pattern: Interleaved Merge

```python
import asyncio
from typing import AsyncIterator


async def merge_streams(
    *streams: AsyncIterator[str],
    timeout: float = 30.0,
) -> AsyncIterator[tuple[int, str]]:
    """
    Merge multiple streams, yielding (source_index, chunk) as data arrives.
    """
    
    pending = {
        asyncio.create_task(stream.__anext__()): (i, stream)
        for i, stream in enumerate(streams)
    }

    try:
        while pending:
            done, _ = await asyncio.wait(
                pending.keys(),
                return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED,
                timeout=timeout,
            )

            if not done:
                # Idle timeout: stop. Cleanup happens in `finally`.
                break

            for task in done:
                source_idx, stream = pending.pop(task)

                try:
                    chunk = task.result()
                    yield source_idx, chunk

                    # Schedule next chunk from same stream
                    pending[asyncio.create_task(stream.__anext__())] = (source_idx, stream)

                except StopAsyncIteration:
                    # This stream is done
                    pass

                except Exception as e:
                    # This stream errored
                    yield source_idx, f"ERROR: {e}"
    finally:
        # Always runs: idle timeout, error, or consumer disconnect
        # (GeneratorExit). Cancel in-flight __anext__() tasks and close every
        # upstream generator so connections are released promptly.
        for task in pending:
            task.cancel()
        await asyncio.gather(*pending.keys(), return_exceptions=True)
        await asyncio.gather(
            *(s.aclose() for s in streams if hasattr(s, "aclose")),
            return_exceptions=True,
        )


# Usage
async def search_all_providers(query: str) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
    """Search multiple providers, merge results."""
    
    streams = [
        search_provider_a(query),
        search_provider_b(query),
        search_provider_c(query),
    ]
    
    async for source_idx, chunk in merge_streams(*streams):
        yield f"[{source_idx}] {chunk}"
```

## 3. Partial Failure Recovery

### Use Case

Stream is partially complete when error occurs:
- Network hiccup mid-stream
- Provider rate limit hit
- Temporary outage

### Pattern: Checkpoint and Resume

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import AsyncIterator, Optional


@dataclass
class StreamCheckpoint:
    """Checkpoint for resumable streaming."""
    provider: str
    payload: dict
    chunks_received: int
    last_chunk_id: Optional[str]


async def resumable_stream(
    payload: dict,
    checkpoint: Optional[StreamCheckpoint] = None,
) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
    """
    Stream with checkpoint support for resumption.
    """
    
    if checkpoint:
        # Resume from checkpoint
        payload = {
            **payload,
            "resume_from": checkpoint.last_chunk_id,
        }
    
    chunk_count = checkpoint.chunks_received if checkpoint else 0
    last_chunk_id = checkpoint.last_chunk_id if checkpoint else None
    
    try:
        async with client.stream(...) as response:
            async for chunk in response.aiter_lines():
                # Extract chunk ID for checkpointing
                chunk_data = json.loads(chunk)
                last_chunk_id = chunk_data.get("id")
                chunk_count += 1
                
                yield chunk
    
    except Exception as e:
        # Save checkpoint for potential resume
        checkpoint = StreamCheckpoint(
            provider="openai",
            payload=payload,
            chunks_received=chunk_count,
            last_chunk_id=last_chunk_id,
        )
        
        # Could store checkpoint in Redis for client to resume
        await store_checkpoint(checkpoint)
        
        raise


async def stream_with_auto_resume(
    payload: dict,
    max_resumes: int = 3,
) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
    """
    Automatically resume on transient failures.
    """
    
    checkpoint = None
    
    for attempt in range(max_resumes + 1):
        try:
            async for chunk in resumable_stream(payload, checkpoint):
                yield chunk
            return  # Completed successfully
        
        except httpx.ReadTimeout:
            # Transient - try to resume
            checkpoint = await get_checkpoint()
            if attempt < max_resumes:
                await asyncio.sleep(backoff(attempt))
                continue
            raise
```

## 4. Stream Transformation Pipeline

### Use Case

Process stream chunks through transformation pipeline:
- Parse SSE format
- Extract content from JSON
- Apply filters or transformations

### Pattern: Async Pipeline

```python
from typing import AsyncIterator, Callable, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')
U = TypeVar('U')


async def map_stream(
    stream: AsyncIterator[T],
    func: Callable[[T], U],
) -> AsyncIterator[U]:
    """Map function over stream."""
    async for item in stream:
        yield func(item)


async def filter_stream(
    stream: AsyncIterator[T],
    predicate: Callable[[T], bool],
) -> AsyncIterator[T]:
    """Filter stream by predicate."""
    async for item in stream:
        if predicate(item):
            yield item


async def batch_stream(
    stream: AsyncIterator[T],
    size: int,
) -> AsyncIterator[list[T]]:
    """Batch stream items."""
    batch = []
    async for item in stream:
        batch.append(item)
        if len(batch) >= size:
            yield batch
            batch = []
    if batch:
        yield batch


# Composable pipeline
async def process_llm_stream(payload: dict) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
    """
    Full processing pipeline for LLM stream.
    """
    
    # Raw stream
    raw_stream = stream_llm(payload)
    
    # Parse SSE
    parsed = map_stream(
        raw_stream,
        lambda line: json.loads(line[6:]) if line.startswith("data: ") else None,
    )
    
    # Filter nulls and done signals
    filtered = filter_stream(
        parsed,
        lambda x: x is not None and x != "[DONE]",
    )
    
    # Extract content
    content = map_stream(
        filtered,
        lambda x: x.get("choices", [{}])[0].get("delta", {}).get("content", ""),
    )
    
    # Filter empty
    non_empty = filter_stream(content, bool)
    
    async for chunk in non_empty:
        yield chunk
```

---

## 5. Stream Rate Limiting

### Use Case

Limit how fast you emit chunks to client:
- Prevent overwhelming slow clients
- Match playback speed for media
- Comply with downstream rate limits

### Pattern: Throttled Stream

```python
import asyncio
from typing import AsyncIterator


async def throttle_stream(
    stream: AsyncIterator[str],
    chunks_per_second: float,
) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
    """
    Throttle stream to max chunks per second.
    """
    
    min_interval = 1.0 / chunks_per_second
    last_emit = 0.0
    
    async for chunk in stream:
        now = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        elapsed = now - last_emit

        if elapsed < min_interval:
            await asyncio.sleep(min_interval - elapsed)

        yield chunk
        last_emit = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()


async def adaptive_throttle(
    stream: AsyncIterator[str],
    initial_rate: float = 10.0,
) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
    """
    Adaptively throttle based on observed downstream consumption time.

    Measures how long each ``yield`` takes to return (i.e., how long the
    consumer took to accept the chunk). Slow consumers indicate backpressure;
    we reduce the rate. Fast consumers allow speed-up.
    """

    rate = initial_rate

    async for chunk in stream:
        before = asyncio.get_running_loop().time()
        yield chunk
        # Time the yield took to resume = rough proxy for consumer slowness.
        consume_time = asyncio.get_running_loop().time() - before

        expected = 1.0 / rate
        if consume_time > expected * 2:
            # Consumer is slow - back off.
            rate = max(rate * 0.5, 1.0)
        else:
            # Consumer is keeping up - gently speed up.
            rate = min(rate * 1.1, 100.0)

        # Pace the next emission.
        await asyncio.sleep(max(0.0, expected - consume_time))
```

---

## 6. Circuit Breaker for Streaming

### Challenge

Standard circuit breakers count failures per request.
With streaming, one long stream = one request, but may have many chunks.

### Pattern: Chunk-Aware Circuit Breaker

```python
import time
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class StreamingCircuitState:
    failures: int = 0
    successes: int = 0
    last_failure: float = 0
    state: str = "closed"  # closed, open, half_open


class StreamingCircuitBreaker:
    """
    Circuit breaker that considers streaming behavior.
    """
    
    def __init__(
        self,
        failure_threshold: int = 5,
        success_threshold: int = 2,
        timeout: float = 60.0,
        min_chunks_for_success: int = 10,
    ):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.success_threshold = success_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.min_chunks = min_chunks_for_success
        self.state = StreamingCircuitState()
    
    async def execute(
        self,
        stream_func,
        *args,
        **kwargs,
    ) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
        """
        Execute streaming function through circuit breaker.
        """
        
        if self.state.state == "open":
            if time.time() - self.state.last_failure > self.timeout:
                self.state.state = "half_open"
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpen()
        
        chunk_count = 0
        error_occurred = False
        
        try:
            async for chunk in stream_func(*args, **kwargs):
                chunk_count += 1
                yield chunk
        
        except Exception as e:
            error_occurred = True
            self._record_failure()
            raise
        
        finally:
            if not error_occurred:
                # Success only if we got enough chunks
                if chunk_count >= self.min_chunks:
                    self._record_success()
                # Partial stream is ambiguous - don't count
    
    def _record_failure(self):
        self.state.failures += 1
        self.state.last_failure = time.time()
        
        if self.state.failures >= self.failure_threshold:
            self.state.state = "open"
    
    def _record_success(self):
        if self.state.state == "half_open":
            self.state.successes += 1
            if self.state.successes >= self.success_threshold:
                self.state.state = "closed"
                self.state.failures = 0
                self.state.successes = 0
        else:
            self.state.failures = 0
```

---

## 7. Streaming Load Shedding

### Challenge

Load shedding for streaming must consider:
- Current active streams (long-running)
- New stream requests
- System resources

### Pattern: Stream-Aware Admission

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import AsyncIterator
import asyncio


@dataclass
class StreamAdmissionState:
    active_streams: int = 0
    total_chunks_per_second: float = 0.0
    
    max_streams: int = 50
    max_chunks_per_second: float = 1000.0


class StreamAdmissionController:
    """
    Admission control for streaming endpoints.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = StreamAdmissionState()
        self._lock = asyncio.Lock()
    
    async def admit(self) -> bool:
        """Check if new stream should be admitted."""
        async with self._lock:
            if self.state.active_streams >= self.state.max_streams:
                return False
            
            # Estimate: new stream will add ~20 chunks/sec
            estimated_load = self.state.total_chunks_per_second + 20
            if estimated_load > self.state.max_chunks_per_second:
                return False
            
            self.state.active_streams += 1
            return True
    
    async def release(self, chunks_emitted: int, duration: float):
        """Release admission slot with metrics."""
        async with self._lock:
            self.state.active_streams -= 1
            
            # Update estimated throughput
            if duration > 0:
                rate = chunks_emitted / duration
                # Exponential moving average
                self.state.total_chunks_per_second = (
                    0.9 * self.state.total_chunks_per_second +
                    0.1 * rate * self.state.active_streams
                )


# Usage
admission = StreamAdmissionController()

## Summary: Streaming Complexity Ladder

| Level | Pattern | When to use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Basic | Single stream + semaphore | Simple proxy |
| Intermediate | + Disconnect detection + metrics | Production single-provider |
| Advanced | + Circuit breaker + admission | High availability |
| Expert | + Multi-stream + aggregation + resume | Multi-provider platforms |

---

## Key Principles

1. **Streaming is fundamentally different** — design for it explicitly
2. **Semaphore duration is much longer** — size appropriately
3. **Timeouts must be per-chunk** — not total time
4. **Client disconnect is silent** — detect explicitly
5. **Circuit breakers need chunk awareness** — partial streams are ambiguous
6. **Admission control must track active streams** — not just request rate
7. **Retries only work before streaming starts** — design for this limitation

**This completes the streaming patterns guide.**
