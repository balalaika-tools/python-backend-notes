# Part 3: Call Patterns and Retry Logic

<!-- length-justification: This is the canonical external-call implementation note; admission, per-attempt execution, retry classification, backoff, and complete composition stay together because their nesting order is the mechanism being taught. -->

> **Who this is for**: FastAPI engineers composing bounded admission, downstream calls, and eligible
> retries into one safe call path.

> **Principle**: Retries must happen outside the semaphore. Never sleep while holding resources.

> **Key insight**: Queue admission, downstream execution, and retry are separate phases with
> separate failure semantics.

## 1. The Gold-Standard Call Pattern

This is the **recommended baseline** for LLM or external API calls:

```python
import asyncio
import httpx
import random
from typing import Optional
from aiolimiter import AsyncLimiter


class RetryableError(Exception):
    """Transient errors that may succeed on retry"""
    pass


class FinalFailure(Exception):
    """Permanent failure after all retries exhausted"""
    pass


class AdmissionTimeout(Exception):
    """Local capacity was unavailable; retrying would amplify overload."""


class AttemptDeadlineExceeded(Exception):
    """One admitted downstream attempt exceeded its wall-clock budget."""


# === GLOBAL PRIMITIVES (must be created once at app startup) ===
llm_sem = asyncio.Semaphore(50)                   # Local concurrency control
llm_rate = AsyncLimiter(60, 60)                   # Local rate limiting (60/min)
client: Optional[httpx.AsyncClient] = None        # Initialized in startup event


def backoff(attempt: int) -> float:
    """Exponential backoff with FULL jitter (AWS-style).

    Sleep is drawn uniformly from [0, min(cap, base * 2**attempt)],
    so retries spread across the whole window instead of clustering
    at a fixed offset. This is what actually defeats the thundering herd.
    """
    cap = 32
    return random.uniform(0, min(cap, 2 ** attempt))


async def call_llm(payload: dict):
    """
    Gold standard LLM call with:
    - Queue timeout (admission control)
    - Rate limiting (throughput control)
    - Semaphore (concurrency control)
    - Call timeout (latency control)
    - Retry logic with proper exception handling
    """
    try:
        # Total budget includes admission, attempts, and retry sleep.
        async with asyncio.timeout(75):
            for attempt in range(3):
                try:
                    # Admission has its own scope and exception. Never classify
                    # local overload as a retryable vendor timeout.
                    try:
                        async with asyncio.timeout(5):
                            await llm_rate.acquire()
                            await llm_sem.acquire()
                    except TimeoutError as exc:
                        raise AdmissionTimeout("local capacity unavailable") from exc

                    try:
                        try:
                            async with asyncio.timeout(30):
                                response = await client.post(
                                    "https://vendor.example/api",
                                    json=payload,
                                )
                        except TimeoutError as exc:
                            raise AttemptDeadlineExceeded from exc

                        response.raise_for_status()
                        return response.json()
                    finally:
                        llm_sem.release()

                except AdmissionTimeout:
                    raise  # fail fast; another local attempt adds pressure
                except (httpx.TimeoutException, AttemptDeadlineExceeded):
                    if attempt < 2:
                        await asyncio.sleep(backoff(attempt))
                        continue
                    raise FinalFailure("downstream timeout after retries")
                except httpx.HTTPStatusError as exc:
                    if 500 <= exc.response.status_code < 600 and attempt < 2:
                        await asyncio.sleep(backoff(attempt))
                        continue
                    raise FinalFailure(f"HTTP error: {exc.response.status_code}") from exc

            raise FinalFailure("all retries exhausted")
    except TimeoutError as exc:
        # This can only be the outer 75-second budget; inner deadlines were
        # converted to distinct exception types in their own scopes.
        raise FinalFailure("total call budget exhausted") from exc
```

---

## 2. Why This Pattern Works

### Layer Order

```
1. for attempt in range(3):     ← retry loop OUTSIDE everything
2.   timeout(5): acquire rate + semaphore  ← admission timeout; never retried
3.   timeout(30): client.post              ← downstream attempt deadline
4.   release semaphore                     ← before retry sleep
```

**Critical**: Retry loop is **outermost**. Semaphore is released before sleeping.

### What Each Layer Does

| Layer | Purpose | Failure = |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Retry loop | Transient failure recovery | Exhaust retries |
| Queue timeout | Admission control | System overloaded |
| Rate limiter | Vendor quota compliance | Throughput exceeded |
| Semaphore | Concurrency control | Capacity reached |
| Call timeout | Per-attempt budget | Vendor slow |

---

## 3. Retry Rules (Critical)

### ✅ Retry These

- Transient network errors (`httpx.ConnectError`)
- 5xx responses (server errors)
- Vendor slowness (`httpx.TimeoutException`)
- Call timeout (`asyncio.TimeoutError` after first attempt)
- 429 responses — retry **only after** honoring `Retry-After` (see §6)

### ❌ Do NOT Retry These

- Queue timeouts (system is overloaded)
- 4xx responses other than 429 (client errors)
- Authentication errors (401, 403)
- Validation errors (400, 422)

**Rule of thumb**:

> If the system is already overloaded, retries make it worse.

> ⚠️ **Retries require idempotency.** A `httpx.TimeoutException` does not mean the vendor *didn't* process the request — it may have completed server-side after your read timeout fired. Retrying a non-idempotent POST (a charge, an order, a token-consuming LLM call) can execute it twice. Pair every retryable call with an idempotency key. See [Part 11: Idempotency](11_idempotency.md).

---

## 4. Semaphore + Retry: Non-Negotiable Rule

> **Retries must happen OUTSIDE the semaphore scope.**

### ✅ Correct

```python
for attempt in range(3):
    async with llm_sem:
        result = await call_vendor()
    
    if needs_retry:
        await asyncio.sleep(backoff(attempt))
        continue
    
    return result
```

The semaphore is released **before** sleeping.

### ❌ Incorrect

```python
async with llm_sem:
    for attempt in range(3):
        result = await call_vendor()
        if needs_retry:
            await asyncio.sleep(backoff(attempt))  # SLEEPING WHILE HOLDING SEM!
```

### Why This Matters

If you sleep while holding a semaphore:
- Throughput **collapses**
- Other requests are blocked unnecessarily
- Effective concurrency = `sem_size / avg_retries`
- Deadlocks appear under load

---

## 5. Rate Limiter Behavior

`AsyncLimiter` (and most rate limiters):
- **Waits** (does not reject immediately)
- Does NOT return 429 to client
- Queues callers fairly

```python
from aiolimiter import AsyncLimiter

llm_rate = AsyncLimiter(60, 60)  # 60 calls per minute

async with llm_rate:  # waits until token available
    await client.post(...)
```

This means:
- FastAPI requests may wait
- Workers are not blocked (async)
- Latency increases instead of hard failing

**If you want hard rejection**, implement it:

```python
async def call_with_hard_reject():
    # Acquire one permit within the rejection budget. AsyncLimiter permits are
    # consumed, not held/released like a semaphore, so do not acquire again.
    try:
        async with asyncio.timeout(0.1):  # very short
            await llm_rate.acquire()
    except TimeoutError:
        raise HTTPException(429, "Rate limit - try later")

    return await client.post(...)
```

---

## 6. Backoff Strategies

### Exponential Backoff with Jitter

```python
import random

def backoff(attempt: int) -> float:
    """
    Exponential backoff with FULL jitter.

    Sleep is uniform over [0, min(cap, 2**attempt)]:
    attempt 0: 0-1 sec
    attempt 1: 0-2 sec
    attempt 2: 0-4 sec
    ...
    capped at 0-32 sec
    """
    cap = 32
    return random.uniform(0, min(cap, 2 ** attempt))
```

**Why FULL jitter (not "base + small jitter")?** A deterministic exponential base with only ±1s of added jitter still leaves every retrying client clustered in roughly the same 1-second window — a synchronized herd. Full jitter draws the delay uniformly across the *entire* `[0, backoff]` window, turning a synchronized spike into a steady trickle. See [AWS: Exponential Backoff And Jitter](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/).

### Decorrelated Jitter (Better for High Contention)

```python
def decorrelated_backoff(attempt: int, prev_backoff: float) -> float:
    """
    Decorrelated jitter for better spread.
    """
    return min(32, random.uniform(1, prev_backoff * 3))
```

### Conservative (429 Responses)

```python
def respect_retry_after(response: httpx.Response, attempt: int) -> float:
    """Use vendor's Retry-After header if present, else fall back to exponential backoff."""
    retry_after = response.headers.get("Retry-After")
    if retry_after:
        # Retry-After may be seconds (integer) or an HTTP-date; handle seconds here.
        try:
            return float(retry_after)
        except ValueError:
            pass
    return backoff(attempt)
```

---

## 7. Exception Classification

```python
async def classify_and_handle(e: Exception, attempt: int):
    """
    Classify exception and decide whether to retry.
    """
    max_retries = 3
    
    # Transport errors — usually retry
    if isinstance(e, httpx.TimeoutException):
        if attempt < max_retries - 1:
            return "retry"
        return "fail"
    
    if isinstance(e, httpx.ConnectError):
        if attempt < max_retries - 1:
            return "retry"
        return "fail"
    
    # HTTP errors — depends on status code
    if isinstance(e, httpx.HTTPStatusError):
        code = e.response.status_code
        
        # 5xx — retry
        if 500 <= code < 600:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                return "retry"
            return "fail"
        
        # 429 — retry with backoff
        if code == 429:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                return "retry_with_longer_backoff"
            return "fail"
        
        # 4xx — don't retry
        return "fail_no_retry"
    
    # Application timeout — context dependent
    if isinstance(e, asyncio.TimeoutError):
        # Only retry once for timeouts
        if attempt == 0:
            return "retry"
        return "fail"
    
    # Unknown — don't retry
    return "fail_no_retry"
```

---

## 8. Complete Production Call Pattern

```python
import asyncio
import httpx
from typing import Optional
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()


async def call_llm_production(
    payload: dict,
    *,
    request_id: Optional[str] = None,
) -> dict:
    """
    Production-grade LLM call with:
    - Structured logging
    - Proper exception handling
    - Retry logic
    - All timeout layers
    """
    
    log = logger.bind(
        request_id=request_id,
        payload_keys=list(payload.keys()),
    )
    
    for attempt in range(3):
        log = log.bind(attempt=attempt)
        
        try:
            # Queue timeout: admission control
            async with asyncio.timeout(5):
                log.debug("acquiring_rate_limit")
                
                async with llm_rate:
                    log.debug("acquiring_semaphore")
                    
                    async with llm_sem:
                        log.info("calling_vendor")
                        
                        # Call timeout: per-attempt latency control
                        async with asyncio.timeout(30):
                            response = await client.post(
                                "https://vendor/api",
                                json=payload,
                                headers={"X-Request-ID": request_id} if request_id else {},
                            )
                            response.raise_for_status()
                            
                            result = response.json()
                            
                            log.info(
                                "vendor_success",
                                status_code=response.status_code,
                            )
                            
                            return result
        
        except httpx.TimeoutException as e:
            log.warning("vendor_timeout", error=str(e))
            
            if attempt < 2:
                wait = backoff(attempt)
                log.debug("retrying", wait_seconds=wait)
                await asyncio.sleep(wait)
                continue
            
            raise FinalFailure(f"Vendor timeout after {attempt + 1} attempts")
        
        except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
            log.warning("vendor_http_error", status_code=e.response.status_code)
            
            if 500 <= e.response.status_code < 600:
                if attempt < 2:
                    wait = backoff(attempt)
                    await asyncio.sleep(wait)
                    continue

            if attempt == 0:
                wait = backoff(attempt)
                await asyncio.sleep(wait)
                continue
            
            raise FinalFailure(f"Timeout after {attempt + 1} attempts")
    
    raise FinalFailure("All retries exhausted")
```

## 9. SDK Retries: Disable or Account For

Many vendor SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) have **built-in retries**.

### The Problem

```
Your retry × SDK retry = retry multiplication

3 × 3 = 9 actual attempts
```

Effects:
- Rate limits blown
- Latency multiplied  
- Cascading failures

### Solution 1: Disable SDK Retries (Recommended)

```python
# OpenAI
client = openai.AsyncClient(
    max_retries=0,  # YOU control retries
    timeout=30.0,
)

# Anthropic
client = anthropic.AsyncAnthropic(
    max_retries=0,
)
```

### Solution 2: Account for SDK Retries

If you can't disable them, do not add an outer retry — let the SDK's internal retries be your only retry layer:

```python
# SDK already retries internally (e.g., up to 3 attempts).
# Do NOT wrap it in another retry loop — that multiplies attempts
# (3 × 3 = 9) and blows through rate limits.
try:
    result = await sdk_call()
except Exception:
    # Let it propagate. The SDK has already retried.
    raise
```

**Rule**: One retry layer. Yours *or* the SDK's — never both. Control it explicitly.

---

## 10. FastAPI Integration

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()


@app.post("/llm")
async def llm_endpoint(payload: dict):
    """
    Complete LLM endpoint with SLA boundary protection.
    """
    try:
        # SLA boundary: absolute maximum latency
        async with asyncio.timeout(60):
            return await call_llm_production(payload)
    
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        raise HTTPException(504, "Request timeout")
    
    except FinalFailure as e:
        raise HTTPException(502, f"Upstream failure: {str(e)}")
    
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Unexpected error")
        raise HTTPException(500, "Internal server error")
```

### What Clients See

| Situation | HTTP Status | Client Experience |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Queue overload | 504 / 429 | Fast fail |
| Vendor slow | 200 | Retry succeeded (transparent) |
| Vendor down | 502 | Controlled failure |
| System healthy | 200 | Normal latency |
| SLA timeout | 504 | Gateway timeout |

## 11. Common Mistakes

### ❌ Semaphore inside retry

```python
async with llm_sem:
    for attempt in range(3):
        result = await call()
        await asyncio.sleep(backoff(attempt))  # WRONG
```

### ❌ No queue timeout

```python
async with llm_rate:
    async with llm_sem:
        # Request might wait forever here
        await call()
```

### ❌ Catching only `asyncio.TimeoutError`

```python
try:
    await client.post(...)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:  # MISSES httpx timeouts!
    ...
```

### ❌ Retrying queue timeouts

```python
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    await asyncio.sleep(backoff(attempt))
    continue  # System is overloaded, this makes it worse
```

### ❌ Per-request primitives

```python
@app.post("/llm")
async def endpoint():
    sem = asyncio.Semaphore(50)  # USELESS - new every request
    async with sem:
        ...
```

## 12. Summary: Retry Decision Tree

```
Exception occurred
    │
    ├─ httpx.TimeoutException?
    │   └─ Yes → Retry (if attempts remain)
    │
    ├─ httpx.ConnectError?
    │   └─ Yes → Retry (if attempts remain)
    │
    ├─ httpx.HTTPStatusError?
    │   ├─ 5xx → Retry (if attempts remain)
    │   ├─ 429 → Retry with Retry-After header
    │   └─ 4xx → Do NOT retry
    │
    ├─ asyncio.TimeoutError?
    │   ├─ First attempt → Retry once
    │   └─ Subsequent → Do NOT retry (overloaded)
    │
    └─ Other → Do NOT retry
```

## Key Principles

1. **Retry loop outside semaphore** — never sleep while holding resources
2. **Queue timeout is not retryable** — overload should fail fast
3. **httpx exceptions ≠ asyncio exceptions** — handle both
4. **SDK retries multiply** — disable or account for them
5. **Backoff with jitter** — prevent thundering herd
