# Dataclass, Pydantic Dataclass, or BaseModel?

> **Who this is for**: Python backend engineers choosing the object that should own an internal
> value, validated input, or serialized API boundary.

Choose a standard `@dataclass` for trusted in-process values, a Pydantic dataclass when an existing
dataclass-shaped API needs construction validation, and `BaseModel` when validation, serialization,
JSON Schema, aliases, and framework integration are part of the type's job.

> **Key insight**: Type annotations describe intended fields; the constructor and APIs around those
> fields determine whether the object is merely convenient Python state or a runtime boundary.

## 1. The same annotation produces three different contracts

Suppose an HTTP payload contains `{"quantity": "3"}`. The annotation `quantity: int` alone does not
decide whether the string is rejected, retained, or parsed.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic.dataclasses import dataclass as pydantic_dataclass


@dataclass
class InternalLine:
    quantity: int


@pydantic_dataclass
class ValidatedLine:
    quantity: int


class BoundaryLine(BaseModel):
    quantity: int


print(type(InternalLine(quantity="3").quantity).__name__)   # str
print(type(ValidatedLine(quantity="3").quantity).__name__)  # int
print(BoundaryLine.model_validate({"quantity": "3"}).model_dump())
# {'quantity': 3}
```

The standard dataclass generates methods such as `__init__`, `__repr__`, and equality; it does not
enforce annotations. Both Pydantic forms validate normal construction. `BaseModel` also exposes the
model-oriented validation, serialization, and schema surface used by FastAPI.

**Success signal:** the three output lines are `str`, `int`, and `{'quantity': 3}`. If importing
`pydantic.dataclasses` fails, install Pydantic v2 before comparing the runtime contracts.

## 2. Choose by ownership, not by which syntax is shortest

| Need | Standard `@dataclass` | Pydantic dataclass | `BaseModel` |
|------|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Generated init/repr/equality | Yes | Yes | Model equivalents |
| Normal-construction validation | No | Yes | Yes |
| `model_validate` / `model_dump` | No | No; use `TypeAdapter` | Yes |
| JSON Schema | No | Through `TypeAdapter` | `model_json_schema()` |
| Pydantic validators/config | No | Supported, with dataclass-shaped ergonomics | Full/default surface |
| Best default | Trusted domain/value objects | Dataclass-compatible validated components | API/config/message boundaries |

A Pydantic `TypeAdapter` supplies serialization and schema operations for a Pydantic dataclass:

```python
from pydantic import TypeAdapter

adapter = TypeAdapter(ValidatedLine)
line = adapter.validate_python({"quantity": "3"})
print(adapter.dump_python(line))       # {'quantity': 3}
print(adapter.json_schema()["type"])  # object
```

> **Core:** choose the representation that owns the boundary. Do not add Pydantic to an internal
> object solely because its annotations look similar to an API schema.

---

## 3. Validation does not make a mutable object permanently valid

By default, Pydantic validates construction, not every later assignment. The following silently
changes a previously valid value unless assignment validation or immutability is configured:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field, ValidationError


class Line(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(validate_assignment=True)
    quantity: int = Field(ge=1)


line = Line(quantity=3)
try:
    line.quantity = 0
except ValidationError:
    print("rejected")
# rejected
```

Use `frozen=True` when replacement is clearer than mutation. Also remember that
`model_copy(update=...)` trusts its update mapping; reconstruct through `model_validate` when the
update is untrusted. The canonical Pydantic mechanics live in
[Pydantic — Data Validation for FastAPI](../fastapi/03_pydantic.md).

---

## 4. What breaks first, and when not to use each

⚠️ A standard dataclass at an untrusted boundary accepts the wrong runtime types; the failure appears
later in business code rather than at construction.

⚠️ A Pydantic dataclass looks like a `BaseModel` but does not provide `model_dump()` or
`model_json_schema()` on the instance/class; use `TypeAdapter` or choose `BaseModel`.

Do not use `BaseModel` as an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) entity merely to avoid defining a
separate schema. Persistence identity, lazy loading, and transaction state belong to the ORM. Do not
use a Pydantic dataclass when callers specifically depend on the `BaseModel` API. Do not add runtime
validation to objects whose inputs are already trusted and whose construction cost is hot without
measuring the trade-off.

> **Production:** define explicit models at trust boundaries, keep secret fields out of repr/dumps,
> decide assignment policy, and test rejected payloads—not only successful construction.
