# Logging

> Python's `logging` module — from the first record to hierarchy mechanics,
> handler routing, async-safe queues, framework integration, and production
> ownership.

## Reading Order

1. **Basics** — understand what a log call creates and who owns configuration
2. **Hierarchy & Propagation** — learn the admission gate and ancestor-handler walk
3. **Handlers & Formatters** — route, filter, render, queue, and shut down records
4. **Patterns** — choose a topology for scripts, services, frameworks, and libraries

**Milestone:** after entry 1, the program emits `INFO __main__ application started`. Stop there for a
small script with one destination. Continue when logger hierarchy, multiple destinations, queued
delivery, or framework-owned configuration is part of the process.

## Prerequisites

- [exceptions.md](../exceptions.md) — know where failures should be handled and logged
- For production structured logging, continue to [structlog_guide.md](../structlog_guide.md)
